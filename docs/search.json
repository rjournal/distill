Author entries must have at least a name and url specified (the affiliation fields are optional). Specify an author’s Orcid ID using the orcid_id field.\r\nThe article’s description and author bylines are automatically rendered as part of the title area of the document.\r\nThe date field should be formatted either as month, day, year or as year, month, day (various notations are supported as long as the components appear in one of these orders).\r\nThe bibliography field is used to provide a reference to the Bibtex file where all of the sources cited in your article are defined. The citations section describes how to include references to these sources in your article.\r\nFigures\r\nDistill provides a number of options for laying out figures within your article. By default figures span the width of the main article body:\r\n\r\nHowever, some figures benefit from using additional horizontal space. In this cases the layout chunk option enables you to specify a wide variety of other layouts.\r\nFor example, if we wanted to display a figure a bit outside the bounds of the article text, we could specify the l-body-outset layout via the layout chunk option:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ cut)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that when specifying an alternate layout you should also specify an appropriate fig.width and fig.height for that layout. These values don’t determine the absolute size of the figure (that’s dynamic based on the layout) but they do determine the aspect ratio of the figure.\r\nSee the documentation on figure layout for details on additional layout options.\r\nThe examples above are based on conventional R plots. Distill articles can also incorporate diagrams and interactive visualizations based on JavaScript and D3.\r\nTables\r\nThere are a number of options available for HTML display of data frames within Distill articles. Here, we use the paged_table() function to display a page-able view of the mtcars dataset built in to R:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that we used layout=\"l-body-outset\" to cause the table to occupy slightly more horizontal space than the article text. All of available figure layout options work as expected for tables.\r\nSee the documentation on table display for details on the various techniques available for rendering tables.\r\nEquations\r\nInline and display equations are supported via standard markdown MathJax syntax. For example, the following LaTeX math:\r\n$$\r\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\\mu)^2}\r\n$$\r\nWill be rendered as:\r\n\\[\r\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\\mu)^2}\r\n\\]\r\nCitations\r\nBibtex is the supported way of making academic citations. To include citations, first create a bibtex file and refer to it from the bibliography field of the YAML front-matter (as illustrated above).\r\nFor example, your bibliography file might contain:\r\n@Book{xie2015,\r\n  title = {Dynamic Documents with R and knitr},\r\n  author = {Yihui Xie},\r\n  publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC},\r\n  address = {Boca Raton, Florida},\r\n  year = {2015},\r\n  edition = {2nd},\r\n  note = {ISBN 978-1498716963},\r\n  url = {http://yihui.name/knitr/},\r\n}\r\nCitations are then used in the article body with standard R Markdown notation, for example: [@xie2015] (which references an id provided in the bibliography). Note that multiple ids (separated by semicolons) can be provided.\r\nThe citation is presented inline like this: (Xie 2015). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.\r\nSee the article on citations for additional details on using citations, including how to provide the metadata required to make your article more easily citable for others.\r\nFootnotes and asides\r\nFootnotes use standard Pandoc markdown notation, for example ^[This will become a hover-able footnote]. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated. 1\r\nYou can also optionally include notes in the gutter of the article (immediately to the right of the article text). To do this use the <aside> tag.\r\n<aside>\r\nThis content will appear in the gutter of the article.\r\n<\/aside>\r\n\r\nThis content will appear in the gutter of the article.\r\nYou can also include figures in the gutter. Just enclose the code chunk which generates the figure in an <aside> tag:\r\n<aside>\r\n```{r}\r\nggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\r\n```\r\n<\/aside>\r\nTable of contents\r\nYou can add a table of contents using the toc option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the toc_depth option. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    toc: true\r\n    toc_depth: 2\r\n---\r\nIf the table of contents depth is not explicitly specified, it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).\r\nThe table of contents will automatically float to the left when the article is displayed at more than 1000px wide. To always show the table of contents on top specify toc_float: false:\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    toc: true\r\n    toc_float: false\r\nCode blocks\r\nBy default the Distill format does not display the code for chunks that are evaluated to produce output (knitr option echo = FALSE).\r\nThe echo = FALSE default reflects the fact that Distill articles are often used to present the results of analyses rather than the underlying code. To display the code that was evaluated to produce output you can set the echo chunk option to TRUE:\r\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\r\n1 + 1\r\n```\r\nTo include code that is only displayed and not evaluated specify the eval=FALSE option:\r\n```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}\r\n1 + 1\r\n```\r\nThere are a number of default values that Distill establishes for knitr chunk options (these defaults also reflect the use case of presenting results/output rather than underlying code):\r\nOption\r\nValue\r\nComment\r\necho\r\nFALSE\r\nDon’t print code by default.\r\nwarning\r\nFALSE\r\nDon’t print warnings by default.\r\nmessage\r\nFALSE\r\nDon’t print R messages by default.\r\ncomment\r\nNA\r\nDon’t preface R output with a comment.\r\nR.options\r\nlist(width = 70)\r\n70 character wide console output.\r\nKeeping R code and output at 70 characters wide (or less) is recommended for readability on a variety of devices and screen sizes.\r\nAs illustrated above, all of these defaults can be overridden on a chunk-by-chunk basis by specifying chunk options.\r\nYou can also change the global defaults using a setup chunk. For example:\r\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\r\n  echo = TRUE,\r\n  warning = TRUE,\r\n  message = TRUE,\r\n  comment = \"##\",\r\n  R.options = list(width = 60)\r\n)\r\n```\r\nCode folding\r\nYou can use the code_folding option to hide code by default but allow readers to optionally show it. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    code_folding: true\r\n---\r\nWhen code folding is enabled, readers will see a “Show code” button like this for each code chunk:\r\n\r\nYou can also specify code_folding on a per-chunk basis. For example:\r\n```{r, code_folding=TRUE}\r\n1 + 1\r\n```\r\nProvide a string rather than TRUE to customize the caption (the default is “Show code”).\r\nSyntax highlighting\r\nSyntax highlighting for R code is done using the downlit package, which provides automatic linking of R functions to their online documentation. By default, highlighting is done using colors optimized for accessibility and color contrast.\r\nYou can customize highlighting behavior using the highlight and highlight_downlit options. For example, to use the Pandoc “haddock” highlighting theme and disable the use of downlit, you would do this:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    highlight: haddock\r\n    highlight_downlit: false\r\n---\r\nAvailable options for highlight include:\r\nOption(s)\r\nDescription\r\ndefault\r\nDefault (accessible) theme\r\nrstudio\r\nRStudio editor theme\r\nhaddock, kate, monochrome, pygments, tango\r\nPandoc highlighting themes.\r\nPath to .theme file\r\nCustom Pandoc theme file.\r\nAppendices\r\nAppendices can be added after your article by adding the .appendix class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example:\r\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\r\n\r\nThis is a place to recognize people and institutions. It may also be a good place\r\nto acknowledge and cite software that makes your work possible.\r\n\r\n## Author Contributions {.appendix}\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage you to include an author contributions statement briefly \r\ndescribing what each author did.\r\nFootnotes and references will be included in the same section, immediately beneath any custom appendices.\r\nTheming\r\nThe appearance of a Distill article can be customized using a theme and CSS just like Distill sites and blogs. You can use the create_theme() function to add a theme CSS file in the current working directory.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate_theme(name = \"theme\") \r\n\r\n\r\nRead more about how to customize a Distill theme. To apply a custom theme to an article, add a theme key to your article’s YAML front-matter:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\noutput: \r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    toc: true\r\n    theme: theme.css\r\n---\r\nOne of the fastest ways to change the default appearance is to use custom Google fonts. To do this, you need to do two things:\r\nEmbed the font using the @import method, and\r\nSpecify the font in the CSS file.\r\nYou can do both of these things inside your theme.css file. For example, here is an article styled with the demo theme detailed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\nA themed articletheme.css snippet\r\n/* base variables */\r\n\r\n/* Edit the CSS properties in this file to create a custom\r\n   Distill theme. Only edit values in the right column\r\n   for each row; values shown are the CSS defaults.\r\n   To return any property to the default,\r\n   you may set its value to: unset\r\n   All rows must end with a semi-colon.                      */\r\n\r\n/* Optional: embed custom fonts here with `@import`          */\r\n/* This must remain at the top of this file.                 */\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Amiri');\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bitter');\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Mono');\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  /*-- Main font sizes --*/\r\n  --title-size:      50px;\r\n  --body-size:       1.06rem;\r\n  --code-size:       14px;\r\n  --aside-size:      12px;\r\n  --fig-cap-size:    13px;\r\n  /*-- Main font colors --*/\r\n  --title-color:     #000000;\r\n  --header-color:    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\r\n  --body-color:      rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\r\n  --aside-color:     rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\r\n  --fig-cap-color:   rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\r\n  /*-- Specify custom fonts ~~~ must be imported above   --*/\r\n  --heading-font:    \"Amiri\", serif;\r\n  --mono-font:       \"DM Mono\", monospace;\r\n  --body-font:       \"Bitter\", sans-serif;\r\n  --navbar-font:     \"Amiri\", serif;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* More properties ... */\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nDistill for R Markdown builds on the work of many individuals and projects.

To create a blog you author a collection of posts (located in the _posts sub-directory of your website) and then dedicate a page (usually the website homepage) to a listing of all of your posts.\r\nGetting started\r\nWebsite or blog?\r\nStructure difference: Websites are just collections of pages you can navigate to via the top navigation bar, whereas blogs have collections of posts that can be indexed and syndicated (via their RSS feed). Distill blogs are a distill website with added blog posts.\r\nLayout difference: Within a blog, Distill enables a special page on your website called a listing page. Whereas websites require you to manually set up links to pages, a listing page collects links to posts for you, displaying key metadata (like date published, author, categories, title, etc.) and a thumbnail image. When you knit and publish a new post, this page automatically updates by adding the most recent post to the top of the list.\r\nWorkflow difference: Furthermore, website pages and root pages of blogs are re-rendered when the site is rebuilt but blog articles are not. Each blog article has to be rendered on its own, with intent. Why? Given that R package upgrades have a tendency to break older code, continuously re-rendering old posts is nearly impossible to do without errors, especially over longer periods of time.\r\n\r\nCreating a blog\r\nIf you are using RStudio, the easiest way to get started is to use the Distill Blog option in the RStudio New Project dialog:\r\n\r\nA new RStudio Project for the blog will be created and opened. The blog will include the following files:\r\nOption\r\nDescription\r\n_site.yml\r\nWebsite configuration file.\r\nindex.Rmd\r\nBlog home page.\r\nabout.Rmd\r\nBlog about page.\r\n_posts/welcome/welcome.Rmd\r\nWelcome post for the blog.\r\nNote that the welcome post is just there to provide some skeletal content for the blog – feel free to delete it and add your own initial post to the blog as described in creating a post.\r\nIf you are not using RStudio you can also call the Distill create_blog() function:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(distill)\r\ncreate_blog(dir = \"my-blog\", title = \"My Blog\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basic scaffolding for a blog and an initial welcome post will be created within the my-blog sub-directory.\r\nConfiguration\r\nAfter you’ve created the blog scaffolding, there are a couple of additional configuration items you’ll want to add to your _site.yml so that it’s easier to share content on the blog via RSS and social networks like Twitter:\r\nA short description of the site. This field is used for the channel description of your RSS feed.\r\nA base_url for the site (the URL where it will be published to). This is used both for RSS feed items and for sharing posts via Open Graph and Twitter Card.\r\nFor example:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\nnavbar:\r\n  logo: images/rstudio.png\r\n  right:\r\n    - text: \"Home\"\r\n      href: index.html\r\n    - text: \"About\"\r\n      href: about.html\r\n    - text: \"Contributors\"\r\n      href: contributors.html\r\n    - icon: fa fa-rss\r\n      href: index.xml\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\nNote that we’ve also added a feed icon to the right side of the menu bar which makes it easy to discover and browse the RSS feed for the blog.\r\nCreating a post\r\nThe easiest way to start authoring a new post is to call the create_post() function from within your blog’s directory. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(distill)\r\ncreate_post(\"The Sharpe Ratio\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will create a sub-directory for your post within the _posts directory, add a stub Distill article, and open the article for editing.\r\nIf you want your post to start out as a draft (i.e. not be included within the listing of all posts) then you can add draft = TRUE. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate_post(\"The Sharpe Ratio\", draft = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou work on blog posts independent of the enclosing website (use Knit to render and preview the post just like any R Markdown document). This is in fact the only way to update post content — posts are considered standalone documents that are not re-rendered when the site is built. This is because posts are often expensive to render and have R package dependencies that may be difficult to satisfy as time goes on.\r\nRenaming posts\r\nPosts are stored within the _posts sub-directory of your site, and have a directory name that reflects the date that you created the post along with the post’s title slug. For example:\r\n_posts/2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio\r\nNote that the date prefix is not strictly required, but is done by default as a convenience so that posts appear in chronological order within the filesystem.\r\nIf you work on a post over the course of a few days and/or if you change your post’s title after you begin working on it, you may want to rename the post directory. You can use the rename_post_dir() function to update the date and/or title slug reflected in the directory name. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\n# rename to reflect the title and date in the post YAML front-matter\r\nrename_post_dir(\"_posts/2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio\") \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also specify an explicit slug and/or date_prefix if you prefer not to use values derived from the post’s YAML.\r\nNote that you should be sure to rebuild your site after renaming a post so that it’s updated URL is reflected in the index page and RSS feed.\r\n\r\nListing pages\r\nOnce you have authored one or more posts you’ll want to create a listing page. You can do this by adding a listing metadata entry to the page you to include the listing on. This is often the main page for the website (index.Rmd). For example:\r\nindex.Rmd\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\nsite: distill::distill_website\r\nlisting: posts\r\n---\r\nIn our example blog (which will be described in more detail below) this results in the following listing:\r\n\r\nCustom listings\r\nAbove we demonstrated creating a listing page for all posts. You can also create a custom listing for a subset of posts (e.g. a gallery of featured posts). To do this, just enumerate the posts you want to include as follows:\r\ngallery.Rmd\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Gallery of featured posts\"\r\nlisting:\r\n  posts:\r\n    - 2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio\r\n    - 2017-11-09-visualizing-asset-returns \r\n    - 2017-09-13-asset-volatility \r\n---\r\nCategories\r\nIf your posts include categories metadata, then the page will also include categories within the article listing. For example, here is some post metadata that includes categories:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\n# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)\r\ncategories:\r\n  - portfolios\r\n  - dygraphs\r\nAs a result of including categories, the listing page now looks like this:\r\n\r\nCategories are listed in the right-hand sidebar and are also displayed as metadata for each post. The name of each post’s author is also displayed in the article listing. You can disable both category displays as well as authors display using collection properties defined in _site.yml. For example:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    categories: false\r\n    categories_metadata: false\r\n    authors_metadata: false\r\nRSS feed\r\nWhen you create a listing page an RSS feed is created automatically for the page (using the name of the listing page with a .xml file extension). You can link to the RSS feed within your site’s navigation bar as follows (some navbar entries excluded for brevity):\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\nnavbar:\r\n  right:\r\n    - icon: fa fa-rss\r\n      href: index.xml\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\nNote that the description and base_url fields are both required to generate an RSS feed.\r\nBy default the most recent 20 articles will be included in the RSS feed. You can change this by specifying feed_items_max within the collection configuration in _site.yml (navbar and output format fields omitted for brevity):\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    feed_items_max: 50\r\nSpecify feed_items_max: false to have no limit on the number of items included in the feed.\r\nRSS options\r\nBy default, RSS feeds include only a summary of each post (based on the description field). If you want to include the full contents of the post (e.g. for syndication to another blog) add an rss: full_content entry to your site config as follows:\r\n_site.yml\r\nrss:\r\n  full_content: true\r\nIf you want to create dedicated feeds that map to particular categories (e.g. to syndicate only a subset of your posts), you can do this:\r\n_site.yml\r\nrss:\r\n  full_content: true\r\n  categories:\r\n    - portfolios\r\n    - forecasting\r\nThe category-based feeds will be created in a categories directory at the top level of the site.\r\nPost drafts\r\nIf you want to work on a post for a period of time without having it be added to the listing page, add draft: true to the post’s metadata. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the\r\n  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. \r\n  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,\r\n  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. \r\ndraft: true\r\n---\r\nWhen you are ready to publish the post, either remove the draft option or set it to false, then build the website.\r\nBeyond support for drafts, Distill has a number of additional features to accommodate a variety of post authoring and contribution workflows, including importing posts published elsewhere on the web (e.g. on RPubs, in a Git repository, or on another blog). The article on blog post workflow describes these options in more detail.\r\nNext steps\r\nComments and sharing\r\nReaders will likely want to comment on and share articles they read on your blog. You can enable support for Disqus comments and sharing links for Twitter, LinkedIn, and other services by adding options to the collection:posts section of _site.yml.\r\nFor example, the following options provide the Disqus shortname for a site and specify that we want sharing buttons for Twitter and LinkedIn.\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r\r\n    share: [twitter, linkedin]\r\nThe following footer is then automatically included at the end of each post:\r\n\r\nNote that the base_url field is required in order to use Disqus and sharing links.\r\nValid values for the share option are twitter, linkedin, facebook, google-plus, and pinterest.\r\nBy default, the full text of Disqus comments are not displayed (rather, a link is provided that will expand the comment section). This is done so that a long comment section doesn’t obscure the bibliography and other appendices. If you’d rather show the comments by default you can use this alterante syntax for disqus configuration:\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    disqus: \r\n      shortname: reproducible-finance-with-r\r\n      hidden: false\r\n    share: [twitter, linkedin]\r\nSpecifying the hidden: false option for disqus will causes all comments to be displayed inline by default.\r\nSite search\r\nBlog sites automatically include a search box within the navigation bar. You can disable the search box using the the search field of the navbar key within _site.yml. For example:\r\n---\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  logo:\r\n    image: images/logo.png\r\n    href: https://www.posit.co\r\n  search: false\r\n---\r\nNote that top level articles within blog sites will also be included in search results so long as they have a description metadata field.\r\nSource code\r\nIf you want to display a link to the source code for your blog on the navigation bar, add a source_url field to the navbar definition. For example:\r\n---\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  logo:\r\n    image: images/logo.png\r\n    href: https://www.posit.co\r\n  source_url: https://github.com/rstudio/distill\r\n---\r\nNote that if you’ve already defined a repository_url field in _site.yml you can just use source_url: true and your repository_url will be used for the link.\r\nOrganizing posts\r\nYou can use whatever scheme you like to organize the _posts directory. You can have all posts at the top level or you can create subdirectories to create groupings of posts.\r\nOne popular scheme for organizing blog posts is to use a date prefix for the post directory names. For example:\r\n_posts/\r\n  2017-11-09-visualizing-asset-returns/\r\n  2017-09-13-asset-volatility/\r\n  2017-03-07-quandl-and-forecasting/\r\n  2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio/\r\nThe benefits of this scheme are that post names are given additional uniqueness (to guard against colliding names over the long term) and are also automatically listed in order when browsing the _posts directory.\r\nNote that if you use a date-prefixed post directory you are not required to specify an explicit date field within your post’s metadata.\r\nPreview images\r\nNote that the listing for our example above includes a preview image for each post. Preview thumbnail images are generated automatically based on the first plot encountered within your post. You can specify that a specific plot should be used as the preview image using the preview chunk option. For example:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\", preview=TRUE}\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ cut)\r\n```\r\nIf you want to use another image entirely as a post preview you add a preview field to the post’s metadata. For example, here we add a preview field to the example metadata from above (some fields excluded for brevity):\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the\r\n  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. \r\n  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,\r\n  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. \r\npreview: images/sharpe-ratio.png\r\n---\r\nPreview images are also used for generating Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata. However, since those systems require that preview images be specified as absolute URLs, you also need to add a base_url field to your _site.yml file as described above in Getting Started.\r\nCitations\r\nIf your _site.yml file provides a base_url field, then an article citation appendix and related metadata will be included automatically within all published posts. For example:\r\n\r\nIf you want to disable this behavior you can use the collections:posts:citations field within _site.yml. For example:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r\r\n    share: [twitter, linkedin]\r\n    citations: false\r\nYou can also disable citations for an individual post by adding citation: false to the post’s YAML metadata.\r\nSubscriptions\r\nYou can add HTML that enables readers to subscribe to your blog by including the collections:posts:subscribe option within _site.yml. The subscribe option in turn points to an HTML file that provides the ability to subscribe to your blog. For example:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r\r\n    share: [twitter, linkedin]\r\n    subscribe: _subscribe.html\r\n_subscribe.html\r\n<form method='post' action='https://blogtrottr.com'>\r\n  <p>Enjoy this blog? Get notified of new posts via email:<\/p>\r\n  <input type='text' name='btr_email' />\r\n  <input type='hidden' name='btr_url'\r\n         value='https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/index.xml'/>\r\n  <input type='hidden' name='schedule_type' value='0' />\r\n  <input type='submit' value='Subscribe' />\r\n<\/form>\r\nThis example uses the Blogtrottr service to provide an email subscription. You could also use another service or simply include a link to your RSS feed.\r\nThe contents of _subscribe.html will be included in both the sidebar of the main listing page as well as in the footer of articles. Note that relative URLs won’t work in subscription HTML since the content appears at different levels of the site (thus we include the full URL to the RSS feed in the example above).\r\nCustom HTML\r\nYou can also add arbitrary HTML to the top of the sidebar by including the collections:posts:custom option within _site.yml. The custom option in turn points to an HTML file that will be displayed above the “Subscribe” and “Categories” sections. Unlike the Subscribe HTML, Cutstom HTML is not displayed in article footers. This custom feature can be used to display anything in the sidebar that Distill does not automatically generate. While only one custom file may be defined per collection, the HTML contained within is extremely adaptable to different use cases (even several simultaneously). For example, the below snippets will display an About section on top, and below that a search bar:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r\r\n    share: [twitter, linkedin]\r\n    custom: _custom.html\r\n_custom.html\r\n<div class=\"sidebar-section custom\">\r\n  <h3>About<\/h3>\r\n  This blog explores reproducible finance with the \r\n  <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\">R<\/a> \r\n  statistical computing environment.\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"sidebar-section custom\">\r\n  <h3>Search<\/h3>\r\n  <form action=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">\r\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"q\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\r\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"sites\" \r\n      value=\"https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/\"> <!-- Replace with your blog URL -->\r\n    <!--<button type=\"submit\">Search<\/button>-->\r\n  <\/form>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\nWhile the custom HTML option inherits general CSS styling from the rest of the Distill blog, by default it does not inherit the sidebar-specific CSS. In order to fully match the rest of the sidebar sections, each section must be nested within a <div class=\"sidebar-section custom\"> tag, as seen in the above example. This configuration is intended to provide a good balance between flexibility and ease-of-use.\r\nThe example search bar functionality uses the popular DuckDuckGo search engine. After entering search terms and hitting the enter key the user is taken to the search engine’s website and shown relevant search results from the blog. Note that the blog will need to have been recently crawled by the search engine in order for search results to be thorough and up to date. Replacing the HTML snippet’s hard-coded blog URL should be the only modification necessary to begin using this example. Other search engines may be used with further modification. The “Search” button has been left out in this example, but may be uncommented if desired.\r\nSupporting files\r\nWhen a blog post is published, resource files located alongside the post in its directory are also published. The following files are not published by default:\r\nFiles beginning with \".\" (hidden files).\r\nFiles beginning with \"_\"\r\nFiles known to contain R source code (e.g. \".R\", \".s\", \".Rmd\"), R data (e.g. \".RData\", \".rds\"), or configuration data (e.g. \"rsconnect\" ,\"packrat\", \"renv\")).\r\nYou can override this behavior using a resources metadata entry for your post, which can specify explicit files to include or exclude. For example (some fields excluded for brevity):\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the\r\n  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. \r\n  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,\r\n  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. \r\nresources:\r\n  exclude:\r\n    *.csv    \r\n---\r\nCollections\r\nAs described above, adding a blog to a Distill website requires creating a “posts” collection (i.e. a _posts directory containing sub-directories, each of which includes an article) and adding a listing page for your posts (most often the site’s home page).\r\nIn addition to “posts”, you can add other collections of articles to your site with their own index pages. The main benefits of including articles within a collection are:\r\nThe articles are never re-rendered unless you explicitly Knit them (which keeps your site building even if the R code within the article no longer runs due to e.g. changes in it’s package dependencies).\r\nYou can generate an index page and RSS feed for the collection.\r\nCreating a collection\r\nTo create a new article collection, do the following:\r\nCreate a top level directory for the collection (e.g “_analyses”)\r\nAdd an entry for it to your _site.yml file. For example:\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts: \r\n    categories: true\r\n  analyses:\r\n    categories: true\r\nOptionally, create an index page for your collection by adding the appropriate listing YAML front matter. For example, you could create a file named analyses.Rmd within the top-level directory of your website with the following YAML:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Analyses\"\r\nlisting: analyses\r\n---\r\nYou may also want to add a link to your listing page in the site navigation menu.\r\nYou can use the create_post() function to create articles within any collection. For example:\r\ncreate_post(\"water-quality-trends\", collection = \"analyses\")\r\nTheming\r\nDistill blogs can use themes and CSS just like Distill sites. You can use the create_theme() function to add a theme CSS file in the current working directory.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate_theme(name = \"theme\") \r\n\r\n\r\nRead more about customizing a Distill theme. To apply a custom theme site-wide, add a theme key to the top-level of your _site.yml configuration file:\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ntheme: theme.css \r\nnavbar:\r\n# (navbar definition here)\r\nBlog posts (along with listing and custom listing pages) will follow the theme. Below are some examples of different themes applied to our demo blog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample themes\r\n\r\nDemo\r\nDemo theme detailed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiping Hot Data\r\nInspired by: https://www.pipinghotdata.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I Sleep\r\nInspired by: https://milesmcbain.xyz/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTidymodels\r\nInspired by: https://tidymodels.org (courtesy Desirée De Leon)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublishing a blog\r\nAfter you’ve authored one or more posts you will want to build the entire site before publishing it.\r\nIf your Distill website is contained within an RStudio project you can use the Build Website command available in the Build pane to generate the site:\r\n\r\nTo build a website from the command line, use the rmarkdown::render_site() function:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\nrender_site()\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of options available for making your site available to others, see the article on website publishing for details.\r\nExamples\r\nThe distill reference site includes several example sites and blogs.\r\nAn example which reproduces several posts from the Reproducible Finance with R series on the R Views blog can be found here: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\nThe source code for the example can be found here: https://github.com/jjallaire/reproducible-finance-with-r\r\n\r\n",

For a blog authored by a single individual, the following simple conventions are typically all that’s required:\r\nAuthor post R Markdown documents within subdirectories of the _posts directory.\r\nMark posts under development as drafts until they are ready to be published.\r\nFor more sophisticated requirements, the following workflows are also supported:\r\nAuthoring posts within their own standalone Git repositories.\r\nImporting posts staged elsewhere on the web (e.g. published to RPubs, located in a Git repository, or published within another Distill blog).\r\nDistill also includes tools for verifying that imported posts are available under an appropriate Creative Commons license and ensuring that posts syndicated from one blog to another give credit within the Google search index to the originating blog. These tools are described below in the importing posts section.\r\nManaging drafts\r\nThere are two distinct ways to manage work in progress on a Distill post:\r\nUsing the draft option to prevent the article from being listed in the article index and in the sitemap; and\r\nWorking on the post within a Git branch and merging/publishing it via pull request.\r\nDraft option\r\nIf you want to work on a post for a period of time without having it be added to the listing page, add draft: true to the post’s metadata. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the\r\n  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. \r\n  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,\r\n  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. \r\ndraft: true\r\n---\r\nWhen you are ready to publish the post, either remove the draft option or set it to false, then re-Knit the post or build the website using render_site().\r\nGit branches\r\nIf the source code for you website is managed within a Git repository then another way to organize work on a new post is to create a Git branch.\r\nOnce you’ve done enough work on the post within your branch, you can create a pull request and then ask others for feedback on the post before it is merged.\r\nThis workflow has some nice benefits:\r\nYou can use the commenting and feedback system of your Git host (e.g. GitHub) to discuss the post in a structured fashion with clear linkages back to the source code. Depending on the service used to publish your website you might get a preview associated with the PR (e.g. with Netlify and GitHub).\r\nYou can manage contributions to your blog from others that don’t have commit access to the blog (anyone can create a pull request for a public repository).\r\nYou can squash and merge to have a clean commit history on master.\r\nThe mechanics of creating branches and pull requests are beyond the scope of this article. Follow the links above or reference other online resources to learn more.\r\nRenaming posts\r\nPosts are stored within the _posts sub-directory of your site, and have a directory name that reflects the date that you created the post along with the post’s title slug. For example:\r\n_posts/2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio\r\nNote that the date prefix is not strictly required, but is done by default as a convenience so that posts appear in chronological order within the filesystem.\r\nIf you work on a post over the course of a few days and/or if you change your post’s title after you begin working on it, you may want to rename the post directory. You can use the rename_post_dir() function to update the date and/or title slug reflected in the directory name. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\n# rename to reflect the title and date in the post YAML front-matter\r\nrename_post_dir(\"_posts/2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio\") \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also specify an explicit slug and/or date_prefix if you prefer not to use values derived from the post’s YAML.\r\nNote that you should be sure to rebuild your site after renaming a post so that it’s updated URL is reflected in the index page and RSS feed.\r\n\r\nImporting posts\r\nYou may prefer a workflow where posts are worked on separately from your website/blog and then imported when they are ready to be published. This might be the case for a few different reasons:\r\nYou want posts to be contained within their own Git repositories\r\nIt’s more convenient for contributors to work on posts independently and then be incorporated into your blog. Example in the wild: RStudio AI blog.\r\nYou want to re-publish posts originally published on another blog.\r\nBelow we will cover how to create a standalone post, how to import posts, synchronize to subsequent updates of those posts, as well as address related copyright and search indexing concerns.\r\nCreating a post\r\nYou want to have a public GitHub repository that contains the html output of a distill post. Here’s a possible workflow using RStudio IDE and usethis, and not taking into account your using private data (that’d you need to add to .gitignore)\r\nCreate a new RStudio project,\r\nIn that project from the new file menu choose “New file”, “R Markdown”,“From template”: distill article;\r\nusethis::use_git();\r\nusethis::use_github();\r\nEdit the Rmd, knit, commit.\r\nNote that with this workflow your name won’t be guessed based on previous posts.\r\nImporting a post\r\nYou can import a post using the import_post() function, passing the URL where the post is published to. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nimport_post(\"https://rpubs.com/jjallaire/visualizing-asset-returns\")\r\nimport_post(\"https://example.com/visualizing-asset-returns.html\")\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also import a post from a GitHub repository. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nimport_post(\"https://github.com/jjallaire/distill-article\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that importing a post does not require the original R Markdown document used to author the post—you only need access to the published HTML of a post to import it.\r\nPost dates\r\nWhen you import a post, the date for the post will be automatically set to the current day (the idea being that whenever the post was authored, the day you import it is the day it’s been published to your blog). You can modify this behavior using the date parameter. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nimport_post(\"https://github.com/jjallaire/distill-article\", \r\n            date = as.Date(\"2017-07-12\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nPost slugs\r\nThe “slug” for a post determines the URL for the post within your blog. By default, slugs are automatically computed using the date and title of the post. For example, the slug for the example just above would have been 2017-07-12-distill-article.\r\nYou can also override the automatically generated slug entirely using the slug parameter. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nimport_post(\"https://github.com/jjallaire/distill-article\", \r\n            slug = \"an-article-about-distill\")\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating posts\r\nIf a post that you have imported is subsequently modified and you want to synchronize to the changes, you can use the update_post() post function. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nupdate_post(\"_posts/2018-07-09-distill-article\")\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also just use the post slug (rather than including the _posts directory prefix):\r\n\r\n\r\nupdate_post(\"2018-07-09-distill-article\")\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Commons\r\nThe Distill tools for importing posts make it very easy to aggregate posts published elsewhere on the web into your blog. Note however that you need to ensure that you have appropriate permission to re-publish these posts!\r\nTo facilitate this, Distill will scan any imported post for Creative Commons copyright metadata, and in the case that none is found confirm that you still want to import the post. Consequently, you should ask that authors writing posts for your blog always include the creative_commons field in their post metadata. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\ncreative_commons: CC BY\r\n---\r\nLearn more about the creative_commons field in the documentation on post medatata.\r\nIf you know that you have permission to import and republish a post you can suppress this prompt by passing check_license = FALSE to the import_post() function.\r\nCanonical URLs\r\nWhen you specify a creative_commons license for a blog post you make it easier for others to re-publish your post, giving you a broader audience for your work. In this case you may also want to ensure that the original URL where your post appeared be the one that appears in search engine results.\r\nTo facilitate this, Distill automatically specifies a canonical url for posts published within a blog. That way, when a post is imported into another blog, search indexes still point back to the original article.\r\nIf you prefer to disable this behavior, you can add canonical: false to your blog’s configuration in _site.yml. For example:\r\nname: \"reproducible-finance-with-r\"\r\ntitle: \"Reproducible Finance with R\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical \r\n  computing environment.\r\nbase_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/\r\ncollections:\r\n  posts:\r\n    canonical: false\r\nWhile canonical URLs are provided automatically for blog posts, they aren’t for standalone articles. You can explicitly provide a canonical URL for a standalone article using the canonical_url metadata field:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\ndate: May 4, 2018\r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Nora Jones \r\n    url: https://example.com/norajones\r\ncanonical_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Distill also provides tools for making your articles more easily citeable, as well as for generating Google Scholar compatible citation metadata.\r\nCiting other works\r\nUse standard R Markdown bibliographies for citing other works. To do this, first create a bibliography file using a supported format (e.g. CSL or BibTeX) and refer to it from the bibliography field of the YAML front-matter. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\ndate: May 4, 2018\r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Nora Jones \r\n    url: https://example.com/norajones\r\n    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets\r\n    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets\r\nbibliography: biblio.yaml\r\n---\r\nHere’s an example of what a CSL bibliography might look like:\r\n---\r\nreferences:\r\n- type: article-journal\r\n  id: WatsonCrick1953\r\n  author:\r\n  - family: Watson\r\n    given: J. D.\r\n  - family: Crick\r\n    given: F. H. C.\r\n  issued:\r\n    date-parts:\r\n    - - 1953\r\n      - 4\r\n      - 25\r\n  title: 'Molecular structure of nucleic acids: a structure for\r\n    deoxyribose nucleic acid'\r\n  title-short: Molecular structure of nucleic acids\r\n  container-title: Nature\r\n  volume: 171\r\n  issue: 4356\r\n  page: 737-738\r\n  DOI: 10.1038/171737a0\r\n  URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/171737a0\r\n  language: en-GB\r\n...\r\nTo cite this within your article, use standard R Markdown notation, for example: [@WatsonCrick1953] (referencing an id provided in the bibliography). See the documentation on Pandoc Citations for details on in-text citations, citing multiple works, etc.\r\nNote that both CSL and BibTeX bibliographies are supported. See the Pandoc Bibliographies documentation for addional details on creating a bibliography for use with Pandoc.\r\nCreating citeable articles\r\nYou can make it easier for others to cite your work by providing additional metadata with the YAML front-matter of your article. Citations can be provided for both articles published to the web or for articles published in journals (with or without a DOI).\r\nWeb articles\r\nTo provide a citation for an article published to the web, include author and date metadata as well as a citation_url. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\ndate: May 4, 2018\r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Nora Jones \r\n    url: https://example.com/norajones\r\n    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets\r\n    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets\r\ncitation_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\nslug: jones2018distill\r\nbibliography: biblio.bib\r\n---\r\nNote that the citation_url field is not required for blog articles (in that case it’s computed automatically using the site’s base_url field).\r\nWhen this metadata is available, a citation appendix is automatically added to the article which looks like this:\r\n\r\nNote that we also included a slug field (in this case jones2018distill) which affects the abbreviated version of the citation included in the BibTeX entry. If you don’t provide a slug then one will be automatically generated.\r\nJournal articles\r\nIf your article is published within a Journal, you can add the following the additional fields to generate the appropriate citation entry:\r\nMetadata\r\nDescription\r\njournal\r\nName of Journal published within\r\ndoi\r\nDigital Object Identifier (DOI)\r\nHere’s our previous examples amended with these fields:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\ndate: May 4, 2018\r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Nora Jones \r\n    url: https://example.com/norajones\r\n    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets\r\n    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets\r\njournal: \"Journal of Data Science Software\"\r\ndoi: \"10.23915/distill.00010\"\r\nslug: jones2018distill\r\ncitation_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\nbibliography: biblio.bib\r\n---\r\nThis is how the citation is presented in the appendix:\r\n\r\nFor Journal articles, the citation_url is included in the BibTeX entry within the note field.\r\nGoogle Scholar\r\nDistill articles automatically include metadata compatible with the format indexed by Google Scholar. This makes it easy for indexing engines (Google Scholar or otherwise) to extract not only a citation for your article but also information on other sources which you cited.\r\nFor example, here is the Google Scholar metadata automatically included for the home page of the Distill for R Markdown website:\r\n<!--  https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing -->\r\n<meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"Distill for R Markdown\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_fulltext_html_url\" content=\"https://rstudio.github.io/distill\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_fulltext_world_readable\" content=\"\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_online_date\" content=\"2018/05/04\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_publication_date\" content=\"2018/05/04\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"JJ Allaire\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author_institution\" content=\"RStudio\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Rich Iannone\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author_institution\" content=\"RStudio\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Yihui Xie\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author_institution\" content=\"RStudio\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_reference\" content=\"citation_title=Distill;\r\ncitation_publication_date=2016;citation_publisher=Distill Working\r\nGroup;citation_doi=10.23915/distill;citation_author=Shan Carter;\r\ncitation_author=Chirs Olah;citation_author=Arvind Satyanarayan\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_reference\" content=\"citation_title=Literate\r\nprogramming;citation_publication_date=1984;\r\ncitation_publisher=British Computer Society;citation_volume=27;\r\ncitation_author=Donald E. Knuth\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_reference\" content=\"citation_title=Dynamic\r\ndocuments with r and knitr;citation_publication_date=2015;\r\ncitation_publisher=Chapman; Hall/CRC;citation_author=Yihui Xie\"/>\r\nNote that the citation_reference fields provide information on which works your article cited.\r\nThe code above is HTML so don’t worry if you aren’t familiar with the syntax. The important thing to know is that citation data is provided in a way that machines can easily read and index.\r\nIf you are publishing a Journal article, there are some additional metadata fields you can provide to enhance the Google Scholar metadata generated by Distill. These include additional fields describing the Journal (title, issn, and publisher) as well fields describing the volume and issue in which your article was published. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\ndate: May 4, 2018\r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Norah Jones \r\n    url: https://example.com/norahjones\r\n    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets\r\n    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets\r\njournal: \r\n  title: \"Journal of Data Science Software\"\r\n  issn: 2490-1752\r\n  publisher: Data Science Press\r\nvolume: 10\r\nissue: 4\r\ndoi: \"10.23915/distill.00010\"\r\nslug: jones2018distill\r\ncitation_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\nbibliography: biblio.bib\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\nContents\r\nDiagrammeR\r\nD3 diagrams\r\nStatic diagrams\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to create diagrams for use in Distill articles, a few worth considering are:\r\nThe DiagrammerR package, which enables you to generate graph diagrams using text (both GraphViz and Mermaid are supported).\r\nThe r2d3 package, which enables you to create fully custom diagrams with D3.js.\r\nFor more highly customized static diagrams you can use a variety of vector graphics tools (e.g. Inkscape) to create SVG files that can be included within your article.\r\nDiagrammeR\r\nYou can use the DiagrammerR package to include GraphViz visualizations within a Distill article. For example, if you have a GraphViz file graph.gv, you can include it with the following code:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-page\", fig.height=2}\r\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\r\ngrViz(\"images/graph.gv\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\r\ngrViz(\"images/graph.gv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that since this diagram is much wider than it is tall, we specify layout=\"l-page\" to provide adequate horizontal layout space and fig.height=2 to ensure the correct aspect ratio. See the documentation on figure layout for details on all available layout options.\r\nDiagrammeR also supports diagrams created with Mermaid. For example:\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\r\nmermaid(diagram = '\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n  participant Alice\r\n  participant Bob\r\n  Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\r\n  loop Healthcheck\r\n      John->>John: Fight against hypochondria\r\n  end\r\n  Note right of John: Rational thoughts<br/>prevail...\r\n  John-->>Alice: Great!\r\n  John->>Bob: How about you?\r\n  Bob-->>John: Jolly good!\r\n')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\r\nmermaid(diagram = '\r\nsequenceDiagram\r\n  participant Alice\r\n  participant Bob\r\n  Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?\r\n  loop Healthcheck\r\n      John->>John: Fight against hypochondria\r\n  end\r\n  Note right of John: Rational thoughts<br/>prevail...\r\n  John-->>Alice: Great!\r\n  John->>Bob: How about you?\r\n  Bob-->>John: Jolly good!\r\n')\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD3 diagrams\r\nThe r2d3 package enables you to include illustrations created using D3.js. For example, the following code renders flare.json using the circlepacking.js script:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-screen-inset\", fig.height=8}\r\nlibrary(r2d3)\r\ndata <- jsonlite::read_json(\"flare.json\")\r\nr2d3(data, script = \"circlepacking.js\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(r2d3)\r\ndata <- jsonlite::read_json(\"d3/circlepacking/flare.json\")\r\nr2d3(data, script = \"d3/circlepacking/circlepacking.js\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an illustration that has lots of detail so it benefits from being rendered at nearly full screen width (layout=\"l-screen-inset\"). We also specify fig.height=8 to cause the illustration (which has a square aspect ratio) to take advantage of the additional horizontal space.\r\nStatic diagrams\r\nFor more highly customized static diagrams you can use a vector graphics tools like Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, or Sketch.\r\nThese programs are all capable of exporting SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Once you’ve exported an SVG you can include it in your article using the knitr::include_graphics() function. For example, to include the SVG file created within this Inkscape tutorial you would use the following code:\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(knitr)\r\ninclude_graphics(\"images/flowchart.svg\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(knitr)\r\ninclude_graphics(\"images/flowchart.svg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis particular illustration uses the default layout (occupying the full width of the article text). Note though that you can use the various figure layout options to control the size and placement of SVG files included from illustration programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This layout is controlled by a set of layout classes, which are in turn applied to R Markdown chunks using the layout chunk option.\r\nThe default layout if layout is not specified is l-body, which will cause content to span the width of the main article body:\r\n\r\n\r\nl-body\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, a plot with the default l-body layout would look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\ninclude_graphics(\"images/l-body-figure.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWider layouts\r\nFor elements you want to display a little larger, try l-body-outset or l-page:\r\n\r\n\r\nl-body-outset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nl-page\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, here the l-body-outset layout is selected using the layout chunk option:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ cut)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\ninclude_graphics(\"images/l-middle-figure.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that when specifying an alternate layout you should also specify an appropriate fig.width and fig.height for that layout.\r\nFull screen layout\r\nOccasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width. For this, use l-screen:\r\n\r\n\r\nl-screen\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a bit space at the edges then you can use the l-screen-inset layout, which adds 15 pixels of padding to each side. Here we use l-screen-inset to display a Leaflet map:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-screen-inset\"}\r\nlibrary(leaflet)\r\nleaflet() %>%\r\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\r\n  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(leaflet)\r\nleaflet() %>%\r\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\r\n  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on the content displayed by l-screen-inset, sometimes it’s nice to add some shading to further deliniate the display. You can do this by adding shaded to the layout declaration:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-screen-inset shaded\"}\r\nlibrary(leaflet)\r\nleaflet() %>%\r\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\r\n  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(leaflet)\r\nleaflet() %>%\r\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\r\n  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatic figures\r\nTo include static figures (i.e. figures based on an existing PNG or JPEG file rather than a dynamically generated R plot), you can use the knitr::include_graphics() function:\r\n```{r}\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/figure.png\")\r\n```\r\nYou can apply Distill layouts to static figures the same way that you do plots:\r\n```{r layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/figure.png\")\r\n```\r\nIf you are including a figure from an external source, it’s good practice to delineate this by applying the external class and adding a caption indicating where it is from. For example:\r\n```{r fig.cap=\"Figure from https://example.com\", out.extra=\"class=external\"}\r\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/heatmap.png\")\r\n```\r\nUsing the external class and providing a “Figure from” link makes it clear that the figure originated elsewhere (and is therefore not covered by any of your article’s copyright or creative commons license grants). For example, here’s how a figure taken from a Stack Overflow post might appear:\r\nFigure from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12196756/Cross-references\r\nWhen you assign a figure caption to a code chunk via the chunk option fig.cap, R plots will be put into figure environments, which will be automatically labeled and numbered, and can also be cross-referenced.\r\nFor example, here we add a fig.cap to one of our previous examples:\r\n```{r diamonds, fig.cap=\"Diamond Prices\"}\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ cut)\r\n```\r\nThe label of the figure environment is generated from the label of the code chunk, e.g., if the chunk label is diamonds, the figure label will be fig:diamonds (the prefix fig: is added before diamonds.\r\nTo reference a figure, use the syntax \\@ref(label), where label is the figure label. So for the example above we’d use \\@ref(fig:diamonds), which would result in a cross-reference like this:\r\n\r\n\r\ninclude_graphics(\"images/figure-cross-references.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor additional documentation on figure cross-references see the bookdown documentation on figures (Distill for R Markdown uses the bookdown implementation of cross-references under the hood).\r\nOne important constraint to keep in mind is that if you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, please make sure the chunk label only contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Distill articles include:\r\nReader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.\r\nFeatures essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, citations, and footnotes.\r\nFlexible figure layout options (e.g. displaying figures at a larger width than the article text).\r\nAttractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.\r\nSupport for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating concepts.\r\nThe ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive visualizations.\r\nA variety of ways to publish articles, including support for publishing sets of articles as a Distill website or as a Distill blog.\r\nDistill for R Markdown is based on the Distill web framework, which was originally created for use in the Distill Machine Learning Journal (Carter, Olah, and Satyanarayan 2016). Distill for R Markdown combines the technical authoring features of Distill with R Markdown, enabling a fully reproducible workflow based on literate programming (Knuth 1984).\r\nCreating an article\r\nTo create an R Markdown document that uses the Distill format, first install the distill R package from CRAN:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"distill\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, use the New R Markdown dialog within RStudio to create a new Distill article:\r\n\r\nYou can also create a new Distill article from the command line with:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(distill)\r\ncreate_article(\"article.Rmd\")\r\n\r\n\r\nDistill articles use distill::distill_article as their output format, and typically include title, description, date, author/affiliation, and bibliography entries in their YAML front-matter:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\ndate: May 4, 2018\r\nauthor:\r\n  - first_name: \"Yihui\"\r\n    last_name: \"Xie\"\r\n    url: https://github.com/yihui\r\n    affiliation: Posit Software, PBC\r\n    affiliation_url: https://www.posit.co\r\n    orcid_id: 0000-0003-0645-5666\r\n  - name: \"JJ Allaire\"\r\n    url: https://github.com/jjallaire\r\n    affiliation: Posit Software, PBC\r\n    affiliation_url: https://www.posit.co\r\n  - name: \"Rich Iannone\"\r\n    url: https://github.com/rich-iannone\r\n    affiliation: Posit Software, PBC\r\n    affiliation_url: https://www.posit.co\r\nbibliography: biblio.bib\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\n---\r\nAuthor names can be specified using explicit first_name and last_name fields or with a single name field. Author entries must have at least a name and url specified (the affiliation fields are optional). Specify an author’s Orcid ID using the orcid_id field.\r\nThe article’s description and author bylines are automatically rendered as part of the title area of the document.\r\nThe date field should be formatted either as month, day, year or as year, month, day (various notations are supported as long as the components appear in one of these orders).\r\nThe bibliography field is used to provide a reference to the Bibtex file where all of the sources cited in your article are defined. The citations section describes how to include references to these sources in your article.\r\nFigures\r\nDistill provides a number of options for laying out figures within your article. By default figures span the width of the main article body:\r\n\r\nHowever, some figures benefit from using additional horizontal space. In this cases the layout chunk option enables you to specify a wide variety of other layouts.\r\nFor example, if we wanted to display a figure a bit outside the bounds of the article text, we could specify the l-body-outset layout via the layout chunk option:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ cut)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that when specifying an alternate layout you should also specify an appropriate fig.width and fig.height for that layout. These values don’t determine the absolute size of the figure (that’s dynamic based on the layout) but they do determine the aspect ratio of the figure.\r\nSee the documentation on figure layout for details on additional layout options.\r\nThe examples above are based on conventional R plots. Distill articles can also incorporate diagrams and interactive visualizations based on JavaScript and D3.\r\nTables\r\nThere are a number of options available for HTML display of data frames within Distill articles. Here, we use the paged_table() function to display a page-able view of the mtcars dataset built in to R:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that we used layout=\"l-body-outset\" to cause the table to occupy slightly more horizontal space than the article text. All of available figure layout options work as expected for tables.\r\nSee the documentation on table display for details on the various techniques available for rendering tables.\r\nEquations\r\nInline and display equations are supported via standard markdown MathJax syntax. For example, the following LaTeX math:\r\n$$\r\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\\mu)^2}\r\n$$\r\nWill be rendered as:\r\n\\[\r\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\\mu)^2}\r\n\\]\r\nCitations\r\nBibtex is the supported way of making academic citations. To include citations, first create a bibtex file and refer to it from the bibliography field of the YAML front-matter (as illustrated above).\r\nFor example, your bibliography file might contain:\r\n@Book{xie2015,\r\n  title = {Dynamic Documents with R and knitr},\r\n  author = {Yihui Xie},\r\n  publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC},\r\n  address = {Boca Raton, Florida},\r\n  year = {2015},\r\n  edition = {2nd},\r\n  note = {ISBN 978-1498716963},\r\n  url = {http://yihui.name/knitr/},\r\n}\r\nCitations are then used in the article body with standard R Markdown notation, for example: [@xie2015] (which references an id provided in the bibliography). Note that multiple ids (separated by semicolons) can be provided.\r\nThe citation is presented inline like this: (Xie 2015). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.\r\nSee the article on citations for additional details on using citations, including how to provide the metadata required to make your article more easily citable for others.\r\nFootnotes and asides\r\nFootnotes use standard Pandoc markdown notation, for example ^[This will become a hover-able footnote]. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated. 1\r\nYou can also optionally include notes in the gutter of the article (immediately to the right of the article text). To do this use the <aside> tag.\r\n<aside>\r\nThis content will appear in the gutter of the article.\r\n<\/aside>\r\n\r\nThis content will appear in the gutter of the article.\r\nYou can also include figures in the gutter. Just enclose the code chunk which generates the figure in an <aside> tag:\r\n<aside>\r\n```{r}\r\nggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()\r\n```\r\n<\/aside>\r\nTable of contents\r\nYou can add a table of contents using the toc option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the toc_depth option. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    toc: true\r\n    toc_depth: 2\r\n---\r\nIf the table of contents depth is not explicitly specified, it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).\r\nThe table of contents will automatically float to the left when the article is displayed at more than 1000px wide. To always show the table of contents on top specify toc_float: false:\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    toc: true\r\n    toc_float: false\r\nCode blocks\r\nBy default the Distill format does not display the code for chunks that are evaluated to produce output (knitr option echo = FALSE).\r\nThe echo = FALSE default reflects the fact that Distill articles are often used to present the results of analyses rather than the underlying code. To display the code that was evaluated to produce output you can set the echo chunk option to TRUE:\r\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\r\n1 + 1\r\n```\r\nTo include code that is only displayed and not evaluated specify the eval=FALSE option:\r\n```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}\r\n1 + 1\r\n```\r\nThere are a number of default values that Distill establishes for knitr chunk options (these defaults also reflect the use case of presenting results/output rather than underlying code):\r\nOption\r\nValue\r\nComment\r\necho\r\nFALSE\r\nDon’t print code by default.\r\nwarning\r\nFALSE\r\nDon’t print warnings by default.\r\nmessage\r\nFALSE\r\nDon’t print R messages by default.\r\ncomment\r\nNA\r\nDon’t preface R output with a comment.\r\nR.options\r\nlist(width = 70)\r\n70 character wide console output.\r\nKeeping R code and output at 70 characters wide (or less) is recommended for readability on a variety of devices and screen sizes.\r\nAs illustrated above, all of these defaults can be overridden on a chunk-by-chunk basis by specifying chunk options.\r\nYou can also change the global defaults using a setup chunk. For example:\r\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\r\n  echo = TRUE,\r\n  warning = TRUE,\r\n  message = TRUE,\r\n  comment = \"##\",\r\n  R.options = list(width = 60)\r\n)\r\n```\r\nCode folding\r\nYou can use the code_folding option to hide code by default but allow readers to optionally show it. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    code_folding: true\r\n---\r\nWhen code folding is enabled, readers will see a “Show code” button like this for each code chunk:\r\n\r\nYou can also specify code_folding on a per-chunk basis. For example:\r\n```{r, code_folding=TRUE}\r\n1 + 1\r\n```\r\nProvide a string rather than TRUE to customize the caption (the default is “Show code”).\r\nSyntax highlighting\r\nSyntax highlighting for R code is done using the downlit package, which provides automatic linking of R functions to their online documentation. By default, highlighting is done using colors optimized for accessibility and color contrast.\r\nYou can customize highlighting behavior using the highlight and highlight_downlit options. For example, to use the Pandoc “haddock” highlighting theme and disable the use of downlit, you would do this:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    highlight: haddock\r\n    highlight_downlit: false\r\n---\r\nAvailable options for highlight include:\r\nOption(s)\r\nDescription\r\ndefault\r\nDefault (accessible) theme\r\nrstudio\r\nRStudio editor theme\r\nhaddock, kate, monochrome, pygments, tango\r\nPandoc highlighting themes.\r\nPath to .theme file\r\nCustom Pandoc theme file.\r\nAppendices\r\nAppendices can be added after your article by adding the .appendix class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example:\r\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\r\n\r\nThis is a place to recognize people and institutions. It may also be a good place\r\nto acknowledge and cite software that makes your work possible.\r\n\r\n## Author Contributions {.appendix}\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage you to include an author contributions statement briefly \r\ndescribing what each author did.\r\nFootnotes and references will be included in the same section, immediately beneath any custom appendices.\r\nTheming\r\nThe appearance of a Distill article can be customized using a theme and CSS just like Distill sites and blogs. You can use the create_theme() function to add a theme CSS file in the current working directory.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate_theme(name = \"theme\") \r\n\r\n\r\nRead more about how to customize a Distill theme. To apply a custom theme to an article, add a theme key to your article’s YAML front-matter:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\noutput: \r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    toc: true\r\n    theme: theme.css\r\n---\r\nOne of the fastest ways to change the default appearance is to use custom Google fonts. To do this, you need to do two things:\r\nEmbed the font using the @import method, and\r\nSpecify the font in the CSS file.\r\nYou can do both of these things inside your theme.css file. For example, here is an article styled with the demo theme detailed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\nA themed articletheme.css snippet\r\n/* base variables */\r\n\r\n/* Edit the CSS properties in this file to create a custom\r\n   Distill theme. Only edit values in the right column\r\n   for each row; values shown are the CSS defaults.\r\n   To return any property to the default,\r\n   you may set its value to: unset\r\n   All rows must end with a semi-colon.                      */\r\n\r\n/* Optional: embed custom fonts here with `@import`          */\r\n/* This must remain at the top of this file.                 */\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Amiri');\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bitter');\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Mono');\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  /*-- Main font sizes --*/\r\n  --title-size:      50px;\r\n  --body-size:       1.06rem;\r\n  --code-size:       14px;\r\n  --aside-size:      12px;\r\n  --fig-cap-size:    13px;\r\n  /*-- Main font colors --*/\r\n  --title-color:     #000000;\r\n  --header-color:    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\r\n  --body-color:      rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\r\n  --aside-color:     rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\r\n  --fig-cap-color:   rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);\r\n  /*-- Specify custom fonts ~~~ must be imported above   --*/\r\n  --heading-font:    \"Amiri\", serif;\r\n  --mono-font:       \"DM Mono\", monospace;\r\n  --body-font:       \"Bitter\", sans-serif;\r\n  --navbar-font:     \"Amiri\", serif;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* More properties ... */\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nDistill for R Markdown builds on the work of many individuals and projects.

For example, the following code embeds a Leaflet map:\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(leaflet)\r\nleaflet() %>%\r\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\r\n  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(leaflet)\r\nleaflet() %>%\r\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\r\n  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also use figure layout options with htmlwidgets. For example, here we set layout=\"l-page\" to specify that we want the widget to span the width of the page:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-page\", fig.height=3}\r\nlibrary(dygraphs)\r\ndygraph(ldeaths)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(dygraphs)\r\ndygraph(ldeaths)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that we specify fig.height=3 to provide a more natural height for a widget that spans the entire width of the page.\r\nTo learn about available htmlwidgets see the showcase page and the htmlwidget gallery.\r\nD3 visualizations\r\nThe r2d3 package enables you to easily incorporate interactive graphics created using D3.js in your Distill articles.\r\nFor example, the following renders an interactive Voronoi diagram created using D3:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-page\", fig.height=6}\r\nlibrary(r2d3)\r\nr2d3(script = \"voronoi.js\", d3_version = 4)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(r2d3)\r\nr2d3(script = \"d3/voronoi/voronoi.js\", d3_version = 4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that we specify layout=\"l-page\" to indicate that we want the visualization to occupy the full width of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\nrepository_url: https://github.com/rstudio/distill\r\n---\r\nYou can optionally also include a compare_updates_url to provide a URL that will show the differences between the article’s current version and the version that was initially published. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\nrepository_url: https://github.com/rstudio/distill\r\ncompare_updates_url: https://github.com/rstudio/distill/compare/pubv1...main\r\n---\r\nIf you include one or both of these fields, then an Updates and Corrections appendix is automatically generated. For example:\r\n\r\nCreative Commons\r\nThe Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a balance inside the traditional “all rights reserved” setting that copyright law creates. These tools give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work.\r\nHere are some of the common forms of Creative Commons content license:\r\nLicense\r\nName\r\nDescription\r\nCC BY\r\nAttribution\r\nThis license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered.\r\nCC BY-SA\r\nAttribution-ShareAlike\r\nThis license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.\r\nCC BY-ND\r\nAttribution-NoDerivs\r\nThis license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.\r\nCC BY-NC\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial\r\nThis license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.\r\nCC BY-NC-SA\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\r\nThis license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.\r\nCC BY-NC-ND\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs\r\nThis license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.\r\nCC0\r\nPublic Domain Dedication - No Rights Reserved\r\nCC0 enables scientists, educators, artists and other creators and owners of copyright- or database-protected content to waive those interests in their works and thereby place them as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law. (See About CC0)\r\nYou can designate articles that you create as Creative Commons licensed by adding the creative_commons field and specifying one of the standard Creative Commons licenses. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\ncreative_commons: CC BY\r\n---\r\nIf you include this field then a Reuse appendix is automatically generated. For example:\r\n\r\nExternal figures\r\nNote that figures from external sources are explicitly carved out of the license. If you are including a figure from an external source, it’s good practice to delineate this by applying the .external class and adding a caption indicating where it is from. For example:\r\n![Figure from https://example.com](heatmap.png){width=100% .external}    \r\nUsing the .external class and providing a “Figure from” link makes it clear that the figure originated elsewhere (and is therefore not covered by any of your article’s copyright or creative commons license grants). For example, here’s how a figure taken from a Stack Overflow post might appear:\r\nFigure from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12196756/Preview images\r\nYou can specify a preview image for your article (for sharing on Slack, Twitter, etc.) in a number of different ways:\r\nYou can explicitly provide the full URL of the preview image via the preview field in the article’s metadata. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"JavaScript & D3\"\r\ndescription: Enhance communication with interactive visualizations \r\npreview: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/images/javascript-d3-preview.png\r\n---\r\nNote that the preview image is specified with a full absolute URL. This is a requirement of both Open Graph and Twitter (relative image references are not supported). If you are publishing a standalone self-contained HTML version of your article then you’ll need to upload the preview image to another location on the web in order to reference it.\r\nIf your article is not self-contained (it’s part of a Distill website or is generated with self_contained: false) then you can include the preview image alongside your document. In this case you still need to specify the root URL where your image will be published to using the base_url field:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"JavaScript & D3\"\r\ndescription: Enhance communication with interactive visualizations \r\nbase_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\npreview: images/javascript-d3-preview.png\r\n---\r\nThis technique is generally preferable to including the full URL since it allows Distill to inspect the image file directly and provide additional information about it’s size.\r\nYou can also specify that a specific figure within your article should be used as the preview image. To do this, just add the preview = TRUE chunk option to the chunk which creates the figure. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"JavaScript & D3\"\r\ndescription: Enhance communication with interactive visualizations \r\nbase_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\n---\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\", preview=TRUE}\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +\r\n  facet_grid(~ cut)\r\n```\r\nAs with using the preview metadata field, this method requires that your Distill article is not a single standalone HTML file (self_contained: false) and also requires that you specify a base_url field indicating the domain and path where the article will be published.\r\nOpen Graph\r\nThe Open Graph protocol is a specification that enables richer sharing of links to articles on the web. Open Graph metadata is automatically generated for Distill articles. For example, here’s what you see in Slack when pasting in a link to the article on using JavaScript and D3 within Distill articles:\r\n\r\nSlack uses Open Graph to extract and display the title, description, and a preview image (if specified) for the link.\r\nTwitter Card\r\nTwitter Cards are a way of enhancing the appearance of links to your article on Twitter. When a link to your article is included in a Tweet, Twitter automatically crawls your site to fetch any available Twitter Card metadata.\r\nSee the section on preview images for additional details on providing an image for your article that will be included on Twitter Cards.\r\nThere are two additional fields you can include that provide attribution for your link to the Twitter account of a website and/or creator of the article. This attribution is specified via the twitter:site and twitter:creator fields.\r\nHere’s a complete example that includes the attribution fields as well as a preview image:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"JavaScript & D3\"\r\ndescription: Enhance communication with interactive visualizations \r\nbase_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\npreview: images/javascript-d3-preview.png\r\ntwitter:\r\n  site: \"@rstudio\"\r\n  creator: \"@fly_upside_down\"\r\n---\r\nBe sure to enclose the Twitter account names in quotes (this is required because they start with @).\r\nGoogle Scholar\r\nDistill articles automatically include metadata compatible with the format indexed by Google Scholar. This makes it easy for indexing engines (Google Scholar or otherwise) to extract not only a citation for your article but also information on other sources which you cited.\r\nFor example, here is the Google Scholar metadata automatically included for the home page of the Distill for R Markdown website:\r\n<!--  https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing -->\r\n<meta name=\"citation_title\" content=\"Distill for R Markdown\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_fulltext_html_url\" content=\"https://rstudio.github.io/distill\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_fulltext_world_readable\" content=\"\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_online_date\" content=\"2018/05/04\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_publication_date\" content=\"2018/05/04\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"JJ Allaire\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author_institution\" content=\"RStudio\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Rich Iannone\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author_institution\" content=\"RStudio\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author\" content=\"Yihui Xie\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_author_institution\" content=\"RStudio\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_reference\" content=\"citation_title=Distill;\r\ncitation_publication_date=2016;citation_publisher=Distill Working\r\nGroup;citation_doi=10.23915/distill;citation_author=Shan Carter;\r\ncitation_author=Chirs Olah;citation_author=Arvind Satyanarayan\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_reference\" content=\"citation_title=Literate\r\nprogramming;citation_publication_date=1984;\r\ncitation_publisher=British Computer Society;citation_volume=27;\r\ncitation_author=Donald E. Knuth\"/>\r\n<meta name=\"citation_reference\" content=\"citation_title=Dynamic\r\ndocuments with r and knitr;citation_publication_date=2015;\r\ncitation_publisher=Chapman; Hall/CRC;citation_author=Yihui Xie\"/>\r\nNote that the citation_reference fields provide information on which works your article cited.\r\nThe code above is HTML so don’t worry if you aren’t familiar with the syntax. The important thing to know is that citation data is provided in a way that machines can easily read and index.\r\nIf you are publishing a Journal article, there are some additional metadata fields you can provide to enhance the Google Scholar metadata generated by Distill. These include additional fields describing the Journal (title, issn, and publisher) as well fields describing the volume and issue in which your article was published. For example:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: | \r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\ndate: May 4, 2018\r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Norah Jones \r\n    url: https://example.com/norahjones\r\n    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets\r\n    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets\r\njournal: \r\n  title: \"Journal of Data Science Software\"\r\n  issn: 2490-1752\r\n  publisher: Data Science Press\r\nvolume: 10\r\nissue: 4\r\ndoi: \"10.23915/distill.00010\"\r\nslug: jones2018distill\r\ncitation_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\nbibliography: biblio.bib\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can send the article as an E-mail attachment or uploading it to Dropbox or any other file sharing service.\r\nThis type of sharing is suitable for private communications to small groups. If you want to make your article available more broadly the following sections cover various ways to do that.\r\nRPubs & RStudio Connect\r\nRPubs is a free service from RStudio for sharing documents on the web. Posit Connect is a server product from RStudio for secure sharing of applications, reports, and plots.\r\nYou can publish to RPubs or RStudio Connect directly from within the R Markdown document preview window by clicking the Publish button:\r\n\r\nNote that all documents published to RPubs are publicly visible, so you should only publish content you want to share publicly.\r\nUnlike RPubs, RStudio Connect is a server that you run inside an organization, so is suitable for publishing content that you only want visible within your organization’s network.\r\nGitHub Pages\r\nGitHub Pages is a service that lets you publish a website from any GitHub repository. While the service supports publishing full websites, it’s also a perfectly suitable place to publish a single Distill article.\r\nHere are the steps required to publish a Distill article to GitHub Pages:\r\nCreate a new Git repository that will be used to host your article.\r\nConfigure your repository to publish the contents of the master or main branch (you can do from the Settings page for the repository):\r\n\r\nCreate a file named .nojekyll in your repository (this is required to disable some processing of HTML files that GitHub does by default). You can do this with the following code:\r\n\r\n\r\nfile.create(\".nojekyll\")\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a Distill article named index.Rmd within the repository (using this name will allow your article to be served as the default web page for the repository).\r\nAdd appropriate metadata to the article. The article should at a minimum include title and description fields, and should also specify self_contained: false (this will make the article load faster and will enable you to add a preview image for sharing the article on Slack, Twitter, etc.):\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    self_contained: false\r\n---\r\nWrite and render your article using R Markdown.\r\nPush the article (including the HTML file generated when you rendered it) to GitHub. Your article is now published!\r\nGitHub Pages are served on the github.io domain (with your GitHub account as a sub-domain). For example, if your GitHub username is jsmith and your repository is named distill-article then the article will be available at https://jsmith.github.io/distill-article.\r\nOther services\r\nNote that any web server or web host capable of hosting a static website can equally well host a single Distill article. See the article on publishing Distill websites for details on publishing articles on a variety of other services including Netlify, Firebase, Site44, and Amazon S3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Website content is by default written to the _site sub-directory (you can customize this using the output_dir metadata field). Publishing is simply a matter of copying the output directory to a web server or web hosting service.\r\nBelow we describe several convenient options for Distill website deployment including [RStudio Connect], GitHub Pages, Netlify, [Firebase], [Site44], and Amazon S3. We’ll mostly defer to the documentation provided by the various services, but will note any Distill website specific configuration required.\r\nPosit Connect\r\nPosit Connect is a server product from RStudio for secure sharing of websites, applications, reports, and plots.\r\nYou can deploy a Distill website to RStudio Connect from the command line using the distill::publish_website() function. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(distill)\r\npublish_website(server = \"https://rsc.example.com\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that once you’ve published your site for the first time you can omit the server argument:\r\n\r\n\r\npublish_website()\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also publish a Distill website directly to an RStudio Connect server from within the website preview window by clicking the Publish button:\r\n\r\nNote that you can either publish your website with the source code (so it can be regenerated on a scheduled basis) or publish a copy of the website you built locally. Generally publishing a copy is more straightforward so that’s the recommended option unless you have specialized requirements.\r\nUnlike the other website publishing options described below, Posit Connect is a server that you run inside an organization, so is suitable for publishing content that you only want visible within your organization’s network as opposed to visible to the entire internet.\r\nGitHub Pages\r\nGitHub Pages is a service that lets you publish a website from any GitHub repository. There are two additional configuration steps required to host a Distill website using GitHub Pages:\r\nCreate a file named .nojekyll in your repository (this is required to disable some processing of HTML files that GitHub does by default). You can do this with the following code:\r\n\r\n\r\nfile.create(\".nojekyll\")\r\n\r\n\r\nSet the output_dir within _site.yml to match the repository directory your site is served from. You can configure GitHub Pages to publish from the root of your master or main branch or the docs sub-directory:\r\n\r\nDepending on your configuration you should set the output_dir as follows:\r\noutput_dir: \".\"     # root of master or main branch\r\noutput_dir: \"docs\"  # docs directory of master or main branch\r\nSee the GitHub Pages documentation for additional details on creating and deploying websites with GitHub.\r\nNetlify\r\nNetlify is a popular website hosting service that allows for both direct upload of website files or integrated publishing from Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) via commit-hooks.\r\nIf you are using Netlify Git integration, be sure to set the publish directory to the output directory of your website (_site by default but modifiable via the output_dir metadata value). For example:\r\n\r\nGoogle Firebase\r\nGoogle Firebase has a web hosting service that enables easy deployment of websites using a set of command line tools.\r\nFirebase websites by default deploy content from the public directory of the Firebase project directory. This means that you should set the output_dir to \"public\" within _site.yml:\r\n---\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\noutput_dir: \"public\"\r\n---\r\nSite44 (Dropbox)\r\nSite44 is a service that allows you to publish websites from within Dropbox folders. Site44 creates a Dropbox/Apps/site44 directory, and any folders within that directory are published as websites.\r\nThe recommended workflow for deploying Distill websites to Site44 is to develop your website in a separate project directory, and then, when it’s ready for final publishing, copy the contents of the _site directory to the folder for your website.\r\nAmazon S3\r\nIf you are a user of Amazon Web Services you can serve your website directly from Amazon S3. Note however that this option is a bit more technically involved than GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Site 44. See the article on Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3 for additional details.\r\nOther services\r\nAny web server or web host can be used to deploy a Distill website. Here’s a recent CNET roundup of other web hosts you could consider. You can also deploy a Distill website on any internal (intranet) web server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For example:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\r\nlibrary(knitr)\r\nkable(head(mtcars))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(knitr)\r\nkable(head(mtcars))\r\n\r\n\r\nmpg\r\ncyl\r\ndisp\r\nhp\r\ndrat\r\nwt\r\nqsec\r\nvs\r\nam\r\ngear\r\ncarb\r\nMazda RX4\r\n21.0\r\n6\r\n160\r\n110\r\n3.90\r\n2.620\r\n16.46\r\n0\r\n1\r\n4\r\n4\r\nMazda RX4 Wag\r\n21.0\r\n6\r\n160\r\n110\r\n3.90\r\n2.875\r\n17.02\r\n0\r\n1\r\n4\r\n4\r\nDatsun 710\r\n22.8\r\n4\r\n108\r\n93\r\n3.85\r\n2.320\r\n18.61\r\n1\r\n1\r\n4\r\n1\r\nHornet 4 Drive\r\n21.4\r\n6\r\n258\r\n110\r\n3.08\r\n3.215\r\n19.44\r\n1\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\nHornet Sportabout\r\n18.7\r\n8\r\n360\r\n175\r\n3.15\r\n3.440\r\n17.02\r\n0\r\n0\r\n3\r\n2\r\nValiant\r\n18.1\r\n6\r\n225\r\n105\r\n2.76\r\n3.460\r\n20.22\r\n1\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\n\r\nOften times tables will require more width for their display than the standard Distill article text width. Here we use layout=\"l-body-outset\" to cause the table to outset slightly from the main text column. All of the available figure layouts can also be used with tables.\r\nPaged tables\r\nIf a data frame has a large number of rows it might not be practical to display it fully inline. In these situations you can use the rmarkdown::paged_table() function to create a table that allows pagination of rows and columns. For example:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a number of options available that control the display of paged tables. By default, 10 rows at a time are displayed but you can use the rows.print option to increase this. For example:\r\n```{r, layout=\"l-body-outset\"}\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars, options = list(rows.print = 15))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\npaged_table(mtcars, options = list(rows.print = 15, cols.print = 5))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the available paged table options:\r\nOption\r\nDescription\r\nrows.print\r\nMaximum rows to print per page.\r\nmax.print\r\nMaximum rows in the table (defaults to 1000).\r\ncols.print\r\nMaximum columns in the table (defaults to 10).\r\nrownames.print\r\nPrint row names as part of the table.\r\ngtsummary tables\r\nThe gtsummary package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready analytical and summary tables. The package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities. For example:\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(gtsummary)\r\nlibrary(survival)\r\n\r\n# build glm table\r\nmod1 <- glm(response ~ trt + age + grade, trial, family = binomial)\r\nt1 <- tbl_regression(mod1, exponentiate = TRUE)\r\n\r\n# build survival model table\r\nt2 <-\r\n  coxph(Surv(ttdeath, death) ~ trt + grade + age, trial) %>%\r\n  tbl_regression(exponentiate = TRUE)\r\n\r\n# merge tables \r\ntbl_merge(\r\n  tbls = list(t1, t2),\r\n  tab_spanner = c(\"**Tumor Response**\", \"**Time to Death**\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(gtsummary)\r\nlibrary(survival)\r\n\r\n# build glm table\r\nmod1 <- glm(response ~ trt + age + grade, trial, family = binomial)\r\nt1 <- tbl_regression(mod1, exponentiate = TRUE)\r\n\r\n# build survival model table\r\nt2 <-\r\n  coxph(Surv(ttdeath, death) ~ trt + grade + age, trial) %>%\r\n  tbl_regression(exponentiate = TRUE)\r\n\r\n# merge tables \r\ntbl_merge(\r\n  tbls = list(t1, t2),\r\n  tab_spanner = c(\"**Tumor Response**\", \"**Time to Death**\")\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacteristic\r\n      \r\n        Tumor Response\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Time to Death\r\n      \r\n    OR1\r\n      95% CI1\r\n      p-value\r\n      HR1\r\n      95% CI1\r\n      p-value\r\n    Chemotherapy Treatment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Drug A\r\n—\r\n—\r\n\r\n—\r\n—\r\n    Drug B\r\n1.13\r\n0.60, 2.13\r\n0.7\r\n1.30\r\n0.88, 1.92\r\n0.2Age\r\n1.02\r\n1.00, 1.04\r\n0.10\r\n1.01\r\n0.99, 1.02\r\n0.3Grade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I\r\n—\r\n—\r\n\r\n—\r\n—\r\n    II\r\n0.85\r\n0.39, 1.85\r\n0.7\r\n1.21\r\n0.73, 1.99\r\n0.5    III\r\n1.01\r\n0.47, 2.15\r\n>0.9\r\n1.79\r\n1.12, 2.86\r\n0.0141 OR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval, HR = Hazard Ratio\r\n    \r\n\r\ngt tables\r\nThe gtsummary package is built in top of the gt package, which provides a flexible foundation for creating just about any sort of table you can imagine. Here is a brief example of how to use gt to create a table from the included sp500 dataset:\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(gt)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(glue)\r\n\r\n# Define the start and end dates for the data range\r\nstart_date <- \"2010-06-07\"\r\nend_date <- \"2010-06-14\"\r\n\r\n# Create a gt table based on preprocessed\r\n# `sp500` table data\r\nsp500 %>%\r\n  dplyr::filter(date >= start_date & date <= end_date) %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(-adj_close) %>%\r\n  gt() %>%\r\n  tab_header(\r\n    title = \"S&P 500\",\r\n    subtitle = glue::glue(\"{start_date} to {end_date}\")\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  fmt_date(\r\n    columns = vars(date),\r\n    date_style = 3\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  fmt_currency(\r\n    columns = vars(open, high, low, close),\r\n    currency = \"USD\"\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  fmt_number(\r\n    columns = vars(volume),\r\n    suffixing = TRUE\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(gt)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(glue)\r\n\r\n# Define the start and end dates for the data range\r\nstart_date <- \"2010-06-07\"\r\nend_date <- \"2010-06-14\"\r\n\r\n# Create a gt table based on preprocessed\r\n# `sp500` table data\r\nsp500 %>%\r\n  dplyr::filter(date >= start_date & date <= end_date) %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(-adj_close) %>%\r\n  gt() %>%\r\n  tab_header(\r\n    title = \"S&P 500\",\r\n    subtitle = glue::glue(\"{start_date} to {end_date}\")\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  fmt_date(\r\n    columns = vars(date),\r\n    date_style = 3\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  fmt_currency(\r\n    columns = vars(open, high, low, close),\r\n    currency = \"USD\"\r\n  ) %>%\r\n  fmt_number(\r\n    columns = vars(volume),\r\n    suffixing = TRUE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nS&P 500\r\n    2010-06-07 to 2010-06-14\r\n    date\r\n      open\r\n      high\r\n      low\r\n      close\r\n      volume\r\n    Mon, Jun 14, 2010\r\n$1,095.00\r\n$1,105.91\r\n$1,089.03\r\n$1,089.63\r\n4.43BFri, Jun 11, 2010\r\n$1,082.65\r\n$1,092.25\r\n$1,077.12\r\n$1,091.60\r\n4.06BThu, Jun 10, 2010\r\n$1,058.77\r\n$1,087.85\r\n$1,058.77\r\n$1,086.84\r\n5.14BWed, Jun 9, 2010\r\n$1,062.75\r\n$1,077.74\r\n$1,052.25\r\n$1,055.69\r\n5.98BTue, Jun 8, 2010\r\n$1,050.81\r\n$1,063.15\r\n$1,042.17\r\n$1,062.00\r\n6.19BMon, Jun 7, 2010\r\n$1,065.84\r\n$1,071.36\r\n$1,049.86\r\n$1,050.47\r\n5.47B\r\n\r\nMarkdown tables\r\nYou can also define tables using markdown.

Distill websites include a top level navigation bar that enables readers to discover and browse articles. For example, the documentation pages you are reading now are a Distill website. You can view more examples of Distill websites on the package reference site.\r\nOnce you’ve created your website locally, there are a variety of ways available to publish your site to the web.\r\nGetting started\r\nWebsite or blog?\r\nStructure difference: Websites are just collections of pages you can navigate to via the top navigation bar, whereas blogs have collections of posts that can be indexed and syndicated (via their RSS feed). Distill blogs are a distill website with added blog posts.\r\nLayout difference: Within a blog, Distill enables a special page on your website called a listing page. Whereas websites require you to manually set up links to pages, a listing page collects links to posts for you, displaying key metadata (like date published, author, categories, title, etc.) and a thumbnail image. When you knit and publish a new post, this page automatically updates by adding the most recent post to the top of the list.\r\nWorkflow difference: Furthermore, website pages and root pages of blogs are re-rendered when the site is rebuilt but blog articles are not. Each blog article has to be rendered on its own, with intent. Why? Given that R package upgrades have a tendency to break older code, continuously re-rendering old posts is nearly impossible to do without errors, especially over longer periods of time.\r\n\r\nCreating a website\r\nIf you are using RStudio, the easiest way to get started is to use the Distill Website option in the RStudio New Project dialog:\r\n\r\nA new RStudio Project for the website will be created and opened. The website will include the following files:\r\nOption\r\nDescription\r\n_site.yml\r\nWebsite configuration file.\r\nindex.Rmd\r\nWebsite home page.\r\nabout.Rmd\r\nWebsite about page.\r\nIf you are not using RStudio you can also call the Distill create_website() function:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(distill)\r\ncreate_website(dir = \"my-website\", title = \"My Website\")\r\n\r\n\r\nA new website containing Home and About pages will be created within the my-website directory.\r\nAuthoring articles\r\nWhen you use the RStudio Knit command on a Distill article within a website, only that article will be rendered and previewed:\r\n\r\nYou can also preview a single article from within a website by passing the name of the article’s Rmd file to render_site():\r\n\r\n\r\nrender_site(\"about.Rmd\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will build only the specified article (as opposed to all articles in the site). This is our recommended workflow for authoring articles since it offers the fastest turnaround time for previews (since only the article you are working on is rendered).\r\nBuilding the site\r\nAfter you’ve authored the various articles contained within the website, you will want to build the entire site before deploying it.\r\nIf your Distill website is contained within an RStudio project, you can use the Build Website command available in the Build pane to generate the site:\r\n\r\nWhen you build a website, the following things occur:\r\nAll of the Rmd and md files in the root website directory will be rendered into HTML. Note however that markdown files beginning with “_” are not rendered (this is a convention to designate files that are included by top level documents).\r\nBlog posts will be copied into the posts sub-directory of the output directory and blog listing pages will be re-generated.\r\nThe generated HTML files and any supporting files (e.g. CSS and JavaScript) are copied into an output directory (_site by default).\r\nThe HTML files within the _site directory are now ready to deploy as a standalone static website.\r\nTo build a website from the command line, use the rmarkdown::render_site() function:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\nrender_site()\r\n\r\n\r\nSite output\r\nThe _site.yml file has a number of options that affect site output including where it is written and what files are included and excluded from the site. Here’s an example that makes use of a few of these options:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"my-website\"\r\noutput_dir: \"_site\"\r\ninclude: [\"import.R\"]\r\nexclude: [\"docs.txt\", \"*.csv\"]\r\nThe name field provides a suggested URL path for your website when it is published (by default this is just the name of the directory containing the site).\r\nThe output_dir field indicates which directory to copy site content into (“_site” is the default if none is specified). Note that this can be “.” to keep all content within the root website directory alongside the source code.\r\nThe include and exclude fields enable you to override the default behavior vis-à-vis what files are copied into the output directory. By default, all files within the website directory are copied into the output directory (e.g. “_site”) save for the following:\r\nFiles beginning with \".\" (hidden files).\r\nFiles beginning with \"_\"\r\nFiles known to contain R source code (e.g. \".R\", \".s\", \".Rmd\"), R data (e.g. \".RData\", \".rds\"), or configuration data (e.g. \"rsconnect\" ,\"packrat\", \"renv\")).\r\nThe include and exclude fields of _site.yml can be used to override this default behavior (wildcards can be used to specify groups of files to be included or excluded). Note that the include and exclude fields target only top-level files and directories (i.e. a directory is either included or not, you can’t exclude a subset of files within a directory).\r\nNote also that include and exclude are not used to determine which Rmd files are rendered (all of them in the root directory save for those named with the _ prefix will be rendered).\r\nThe R Markdown documentation on creating websites has documentation on additional available features and configuration options. The remainder of this article describes features that are specific to Distill websites.\r\nSite navigation\r\nSite navigation bars include the site’s title, an optional logo, top-level links to articles, and if need be drop-down menus that include links to several articles. For example:\r\n\r\nElements of the site navigation bar are specified within the navbar section of the _site.yml file. For example, here is the YAML that was used to create the navigation bar displayed above:\r\n---\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  logo:\r\n    image: images/logo.png\r\n    href: https://www.posit.co\r\n  right:\r\n    - text: \"Figures\"\r\n      href: figures.html\r\n    - text: \"Tables\"\r\n      href: tables.html\r\n    - text: \"Citations\"\r\n      href: citations.html\r\n    - text: \"Publish\"\r\n      menu:\r\n        - text: \"Publishing Articles\"\r\n          href: publish_article.html\r\n        - text: \"Publishing a Website\"\r\n          href: publish_website.html\r\n        - text: \"---\"\r\n        - text: \"Article Metadata\"\r\n          href: metadata.html\r\n    - icon: fab fa-github\r\n      href: https://github.com/rstudio/distill\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\n---\r\nNote that we specify that the menu items appear on the right side of the navigation bar. We could have also used left, or chosen to put some items on the left and some on the right.\r\nNote also that we used an icon for one of the menus, specifying the Font Awesome fab fa-github identifier for the GitHub icon (you can use any Font Awesome icon). If there isn’t a Font Awesome icon that matches the image you want, you can also specify a custom image rather than an icon.\r\nSite search\r\nYou can add a search box to the navigation bar using the search field of the navbar key within _site.yml. For example:\r\n---\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  logo:\r\n    image: images/logo.png\r\n    href: https://www.posit.co\r\n  search: true\r\n---\r\nNote that only articles with a description metadata field are included within search results. Also note that search is enabled by default for blog sites.\r\nSource code\r\nIf you want to display a link to the source code for your website on the navigation bar, add a source_url field to the navbar definition. For example:\r\n---\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  logo:\r\n    image: images/logo.png\r\n    href: https://www.posit.co\r\n  source_url: https://github.com/rstudio/distill\r\n---\r\nNote that if you’ve already defined a repository_url field in _site.yml you can just use source_url: true and your repository_url will be used for the link.\r\nSite footer\r\nWhen you use a navigation bar, you can optionally also include a site footer which uses the same theme (background and foreground colors). For example:\r\n\r\nTo add a footer, simply include a file named _footer.html within your main site directory. For example:\r\n_footer.html\r\n© Copyright 2018-2023 [The Distill Template Authors]\r\n(https://github.com/distillpub/template/blob/master/AUTHORS) \r\nand [Posit Software, PBC](https://www.posit.co).\r\n\r\nSoftware licensed under the [Apache License, v2.0]\r\n(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\nAlternate formats\r\nWhile you’ll typically use the distill::distill_article format for pages within a distill website, you can also use any other HTML-based, single document R Markdown formats so long as it’s underlying template has support for pandoc includes.\r\nSupport for alternate output formats requires up-to-date versions of both the distill and rmarkdown packages:\r\nversion >= 1.2 of distill\r\nversion >= 2.7 of rmarkdown\r\nYou can check these package versions as follows:\r\npackageVersion(\"distill\")\r\npackageVersion(\"rmarkdown\")\r\nAlternate output formats are supported only for top-level site pages (not for articles within collections, e.g. blog posts). Pages using an alternate format should be rendered via the rmarkdown::render_site() function to ensure they get site-related headers and footers (this happens automatically when you Knit from within an RStudio website project).\r\nYou can disable support for rendering alternate formats by including alt_formats: false within your _site.yml file.\r\nPostcards\r\nThe postcards package enables you to create an attractive personal bio/contact page. To add a postcard to your Distill site, first install the postcards packages from CRAN:\r\ninstall.packages(\"postcards\")\r\nThen use the create_postcard() function:\r\npostcards::create_postcard(\"about.Rmd\")\r\nNote that you can choose from several different postcard templates using the template argument of the create_postcard() function; the default is template = \"jolla\". After creating your postcard, you may switch templates by editing the YAML; here we’ll switch to using the trestles template:\r\n---\r\noutput:\r\n  postcards::trestles\r\n---\r\nWhen you rebuild your site, the template should update.\r\nYou’ll likely also want to add a link to the postcard page within your site’s navigation bar. For example:\r\nnavbar:\r\n  right:\r\n    - text: \"About\"\r\n      href: about.html\r\nTheming\r\nDistill ships with a default CSS framework that can be fully customized. To change the appearance of your Distill site or blog, you can use CSS to override the default values, provided you are comfortable writing CSS rules and selecting CSS elements. Alternatively, you may create and apply a Distill theme, which allows you to customize common elements without needing to create a CSS file from scratch.\r\nCreate theme\r\nYou can use the create_theme() function to add a theme CSS file in the current working directory.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate_theme(name = \"theme\") \r\n\r\n\r\nThis function creates a file named theme with the file extension .css. The file defines CSS custom properties that you can edit to create a custom Distill theme. This file has several sections, defined by a common scope. For each scoped section, you’ll find multiple properties that are defined that look something like this:\r\nscope {\r\n  --a-property:       50px;\r\n  --another-property: #fff;\r\n}\r\nThe values provided for each property (i.e., those in the right-most column) are the default values. For example, this portion at the top of the file allows you to quickly change the main font sizes for any Distill output format:\r\nhtml {\r\n  /*-- Main font sizes --*/\r\n  --title-size:      50px;\r\n  --body-size:       1.06rem;\r\n  --code-size:       14px;\r\n  --aside-size:      12px;\r\n  --fig-cap-size:    13px;\r\n  /*-- More properties --*/\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\nChanging the values for each custom property is akin to developing your own custom CSS rules, but the theme allows you to bypass the detective work typically involved in discovering which CSS selectors are needed to change the key elements most users wish to control.\r\nWe’ll demonstrate how to edit and use a theme by showing a single article within a Distill website. The default theme is shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: The default Distill theme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the fastest ways to change the default appearance is to use custom Google fonts. To do this, you need to do two things:\r\nEmbed the font using the @import method, and\r\nSpecify the font in the CSS file.\r\nYou can do both of these things inside your theme.css file. For example, let’s import the Amiri, Bitter, and DM Mono fonts:\r\n/* Optional: embed custom fonts here with `@import`          */\r\n/* This must remain at the top of this file.                 */\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Amiri');\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bitter');\r\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Mono');\r\nThe @import requests must be at the very top of your theme.css, before any rules. Next, scroll down to the bottom of the properties with the html scope to specify the embedded fonts:\r\nhtml {\r\n  ...\r\n  /*-- Specify custom fonts ~~~ must be imported above   --*/\r\n  --heading-font:    \"Amiri\", serif;\r\n  --mono-font:       \"DM Mono\", monospace;\r\n  --body-font:       \"Bitter\", sans-serif;\r\n  --navbar-font:     \"Amiri\", serif;\r\n}\r\nBut we can go even further! Let’s also change the background color of the navbar, the text color, and the hover color. These three properties are listed with the .distill-site-header scope. For example:\r\n/*-- WEBSITE HEADER + FOOTER --*/\r\n/* These properties only apply to Distill sites and blogs  */\r\n\r\n.distill-site-header {\r\n  --title-size:       18px;    \r\n  --text-color:       #ff414b; /* edited */\r\n  --text-size:        15px;\r\n  --hover-color:      #dd424c; /* edited */\r\n  --bkgd-color:       #ffd8db; /* edited */\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur new custom theme is shown below. In this example, we only changed four font properties and three website header properties, and already our site looks quite different from the default.\r\n\r\nThemed site\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: A custom Distill theme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefault site\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: The default Distill theme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo preview your custom Distill theme, you’ll also need to apply it to your article or site.\r\nAs you can see, we include a lot more properties for you to explore and edit in your own custom theme. If you find yourself editing too much and want to return back to a default value, you may set any property to unset. For example:\r\nhtml {\r\n  /*-- Main font sizes --*/\r\n  --title-size:      unset;\r\n}\r\nOf course, there may be additional properties that you’d like to change, and you may always add in your own custom CSS rules in the space provided at the bottom of your theme file, or in a separate .css file.\r\nTo see your theme in action, you’ll need to also apply it to your article or site.\r\nApply theme\r\nThe previous section described how to create and customize a Distill theme file.\r\nHow do you apply a custom theme to a Distill site or blog? You have two options:\r\nApply it site-wide by adding a theme key to the top-level of your _site.yml configuration file:\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\ntheme: theme.css\r\nnavbar:\r\n  # (navbar definition here)\r\nApply to an individual article by adding a theme key to your article’s YAML front-matter:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"The Sharpe Ratio\"\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    toc: true\r\n    theme: theme.css\r\n---\r\nThe second option allows for you to apply your theme to individual articles, while using a different theme for the rest of your site. Note that this is only possible for stand-alone articles within a website — you cannot apply a theme to individual blog posts only.\r\n\r\nBlog posts (along with listing and custom listing pages) will follow the theme if you use the first option and add it to your _site.yml.\r\nCustom CSS styles\r\nIf you prefer working with CSS directly, or you would like to change site elements not included in the theme file, you can define your own CSS as well. For example, we can override the default styles for bullets and links by adding additional CSS rules in the space provided at the bottom of your theme.css. We’ll add the following CSS rules on top of the theme we made in the previous section:\r\n/*-- Additional custom styles --*/\r\n/* Add any additional CSS rules below                      */\r\n\r\n/* Change bullets */\r\nul > li::marker {\r\n  font-size: 1.125em;\r\n  color: #ff414b;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Change link appearance */\r\nd-article a {\r\n  border-bottom: 2px solid #ffd8db;\r\n  text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\nHere is the before (left) and after (right):\r\n\r\n\r\nknitr::include_graphics(c(\"images/css-before.png\", \"images/css-after.png\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing CSS, you can change anything about your site’s appearance. For example, the distill-site-nav class addresses both the header and footer, whereas the distill-site-header and distill-site-footer apply (respectively) to just the header and footer. Here is the CSS used for the default appearance:\r\n.distill-site-nav {\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);\r\n  background-color: #455a64;\r\n  font-size: 15px;\r\n  font-weight: 300;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.distill-site-nav a {\r\n  color: inherit;\r\n  text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.distill-site-nav a:hover {\r\n  color: white;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.distill-site-header {\r\n}\r\n\r\n.distill-site-footer {\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media print {\r\n  .distill-site-nav {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nTo override any CSS properties, you may include a styles.css file in the main site directory and add a reference to it within your site output options. For example:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  # (navbar definition here)\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    css: styles.css\r\nExample themes\r\nBelow are some sample themes to see what is possible using a Distill theme, plus a handful of custom CSS rules.\r\nPiping Hot Data\r\n\r\nInspiration\r\nhttps://www.pipinghotdata.com/\r\nScreenshot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheme.css\r\n/* base variables */\r\n\r\n/* Edit the CSS properties in this file to create a custom\r\n   Distill theme.

For example:\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nbase_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\ngoogle_analytics: \"UA-77306155-2\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  # (navbar definition here)\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\nThe Google Analytics tracking code will be automatically included on all pages of your website.\r\nGDPR compliance\r\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this section does not, and is not intended to, constitute legal advice; instead, all information, content, and materials available in this section are for general informational purposes only.\r\nWhen using Google Analytics, Disqus and other services that set cookies in the end-user’s browser, it is important to ensure compliance with Data Protection regulations, e.g., GDPR among others. Besides the GDPR many countries are imposing their own data privacy laws, and leading law experts expect that the pace of legislation in this field, will continue accelerating through the foreseeable future.\r\nThe GDPR is one of the strictest and most far-reaching of these regulations, imposing obligations onto data controllers anywhere in the world, who processes personal data of subjects residing in the EU. Therefore, the GDPR is also a great standard to ensure compliance with most data protection regulations in general. In order to ensure compliance with the GDPR, data controllers must acquire consent from data subjects, before processing their personal information, and this also includes setting web cookies.\r\nCookie consent\r\nOne way of requesting consent is through a Cookie Consent banner, which can be enabled in the _site.yml like so:\r\n_site.yml\r\ncookie_consent:\r\n  style: simple\r\n  type: express\r\n  palette: light\r\n  lang: en\r\n  cookies_policy: url\r\nThe cookie consent banner is generated using a javascript plugin from Cookieconsent.com, which features different options for customizing the banner.\r\nstyle: simple/headline/interstitial/standalone\r\ntype: express/implied\r\npalette: light/dark\r\nlang: en/de/fr/es/ca_es/it/nl/pt/fi/hu/cs/hr/da/sl/pl/ro/sr/bg/cy\r\ncookies_policy: link to cookies policy\r\nThe banner will be shown automatically if you use either Google Analytics or Disqus on your site.\r\nTagging scripts\r\nIf your site uses custom JavaScript that sets cookies, these should be tagged as text/plain and either as “strictly-necessary”, “functionality”, “tracking” or “targeting”. For example:\r\n<script type=\"text/plain\" cookie-consent=\"functionality\" src=\"myscript.js\"><\/script>\r\nNote that besides having a cookie consent banner, to ensure GDPR compliance, your site should have a Cookies policy separate from your Privacy policy, and also allow site users to change cookie preferences. A button to open the Cookie Preferences Center can be added to the footer, by creating a button or a link with the id-tag set to CookiePreferences, in _footer.html. For example:\r\n<a id='CookiePreferences'>Cookie Preferences<\/a>\r\nSite metadata\r\nDistill articles can include various types of metadata to make them easier to index, cite, and share. Metadata included within your _site.yml file is conveniently shared across all articles on your site (individual articles can always override any value within their own metadata).\r\nSeveral metadata values which you might find useful to define in _site.yml are:\r\nMetadata\r\nDescription\r\nbase_url\r\nBase (root) URL for the location where the website will be deployed (used for providing preview images for Open Graph and Twitter Card).\r\nrepository_url\r\nURL for the source code of your website. Used to create a navbar link back to the repository and to create a Corrections appendix.\r\ncreative_commons\r\nCreative Commons license terms for website content. Used to automatically generate a Reuse appendix.\r\nlicense_url\r\nAlternate licensing terms for website content if not using a Creative Commons license.\r\nfavicon\r\nFavicon (image file) to use for browser tabs/bookmarks\r\ntwitter\r\nSite handle for Twitter Card metadata\r\nHere’s a _site.yml file that uses all of these fields (save for license_url since the license is already specified via creative_commons):\r\n_site.yml\r\nname: \"distill\"\r\ntitle: \"Distill for R Markdown\"\r\nfavicon: images/favicon.png\r\nbase_url: https://rstudio.github.io/distill\r\nrepository_url: https://github.com/rstudio/distill\r\ncreative_commons: CC BY\r\ntwitter:\r\n  site: \"@distilljournal\"\r\nnavbar:\r\n  # (navbar definition here)\r\noutput: distill::distill_article\r\nBe sure to enclose Twitter account names in quotes (this is required because they start with @).\r\nPublishing a website\r\nWebsite content is by default written to the _site sub-directory (you can customize this using the output_dir metadata field). Publishing is simply a matter of copying the output directory to a web server or web hosting service.\r\nSee the article on publishing websites for additional details on publishing sites using a variety of available hosting services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
