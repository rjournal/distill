description: Create a blog to publish a collection of Distill articles
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

Distill for R Markdown websites include integrated support for blogging. To create a blog you author a collection of posts (located in the `_posts` sub-directory of your website) and then dedicate a page (usually the website homepage) to a listing of all of your posts.

## Getting started

```{r, child="_common/website_vs_blog.Rmd"}
```

### Creating a blog

If you are using RStudio, the easiest way to get started is to use the Distill Blog option in the RStudio **New Project** dialog:

![](images/create-blog.png){.screenshot width="95%"}

A new [RStudio Project](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) for the blog will be created and opened. The blog will include the following files:

| Option                       | Description                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `_site.yml`                  | Website configuration file. |
| `index.Rmd`                  | Blog home page.             |
| `about.Rmd`                  | Blog about page.            |
| `_posts/welcome/welcome.Rmd` | Welcome post for the blog.  |

Note that the `welcome` post is just there to provide some skeletal content for the blog -- feel free to delete it and add your own initial post to the blog as described in [creating a post].

If you are not using RStudio you can also call the Distill `create_blog()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(distill)
create_blog(dir = "my-blog", title = "My Blog")
```

The basic scaffolding for a blog and an initial welcome post will be created within the `my-blog` sub-directory.

### Configuration

After you've created the blog scaffolding, there are a couple of additional configuration items you'll want to add to your `_site.yml` so that it's easier to share content on the blog via RSS and social networks like Twitter:

-   A short `description` of the site. This field is used for the channel description of your RSS feed.

-   A `base_url` for the site (the URL where it will be published to). This is used both for RSS feed items and for sharing posts via [Open Graph](metadata.html#open-graph) and [Twitter Card](metadata.html#twitter-card).

For example:

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/
navbar:
  logo: images/rstudio.png
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - text: "Contributors"
      href: contributors.html
    - icon: fa fa-rss
      href: index.xml
output: distill::distill_article
```

Note that we've also added a feed icon to the right side of the menu bar which makes it easy to discover and browse the RSS feed for the blog.

### Creating a post

The easiest way to start authoring a new post is to call the `create_post()` function from within your blog's directory. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(distill)
create_post("The Sharpe Ratio")
```

This will create a sub-directory for your post within the `_posts` directory, add a stub Distill article, and open the article for editing.

If you want your post to start out as a draft (i.e. not be included within the listing of all posts) then you can add `draft = TRUE`. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
create_post("The Sharpe Ratio", draft = TRUE)
```

You work on blog posts independent of the enclosing website (use **Knit** to render and preview the post just like any R Markdown document). This is in fact the only way to update post content --- posts are considered standalone documents that are not re-rendered when the site is built. This is because posts are often expensive to render and have R package dependencies that may be difficult to satisfy as time goes on.

### Renaming posts

```{r, child="_common/renaming_posts.Rmd"}
```

### Listing pages {#listing-pages}

Once you have authored one or more posts you'll want to create a listing page. You can do this by adding a `listing` metadata entry to the page you to include the listing on. This is often the main page for the website (index.Rmd). For example:

**index.Rmd**

``` yaml
---
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
site: distill::distill_website
listing: posts
---
```

In our [example blog](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/) (which will be described in more detail below) this results in the following listing:

![](images/site-listing.png){.screenshot width="95%"}

#### Custom listings {#custom-listings}

Above we demonstrated creating a listing page for all posts. You can also create a custom listing for a subset of posts (e.g. a gallery of featured posts). To do this, just enumerate the posts you want to include as follows:

**gallery.Rmd**

``` yaml
---
title: "Gallery of featured posts"
listing:
  posts:
    - 2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio
    - 2017-11-09-visualizing-asset-returns 
    - 2017-09-13-asset-volatility 
---
```

#### Categories

If your posts include `categories` metadata, then the page will also include categories within the article listing. For example, here is some post metadata that includes categories:

``` yaml
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)
categories:
  - portfolios
  - dygraphs
```

As a result of including `categories`, the listing page now looks like this:

![](images/site-listing-categories.png){.screenshot width="95%"}

Categories are listed in the right-hand sidebar and are also displayed as metadata for each post. The name of each post's author is also displayed in the article listing. You can disable both category displays as well as authors display using `collection` properties defined in `_site.yml`. For example:

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/
collections:
  posts:
    categories: false
    categories_metadata: false
    authors_metadata: false
```

### RSS feed

When you create a listing page an [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is created automatically for the page (using the name of the listing page with a `.xml` file extension). You can link to the RSS feed within your site's navigation bar as follows (some navbar entries excluded for brevity):

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/
navbar:
  right:
    - icon: fa fa-rss
      href: index.xml
output: distill::distill_article
```

Note that the `description` and `base_url` fields are both required to generate an RSS feed.

By default the most recent 20 articles will be included in the RSS feed. You can change this by specifying `feed_items_max` within the collection configuration in `_site.yml` (navbar and output format fields omitted for brevity):

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/
collections:
  posts:
    feed_items_max: 50
```

Specify `feed_items_max: false` to have no limit on the number of items included in the feed.

#### RSS options

By default, RSS feeds include only a summary of each post (based on the `description` field). If you want to include the full contents of the post (e.g. for syndication to another blog) add an `rss: full_content` entry to your site config as follows:

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
rss:
  full_content: true
```

If you want to create dedicated feeds that map to particular categories (e.g. to syndicate only a subset of your posts), you can do this:

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
rss:
  full_content: true
  categories:
    - portfolios
    - forecasting
```

The category-based feeds will be created in a `categories` directory at the top level of the site.

### Post drafts

If you want to work on a post for a period of time without having it be added to the listing page, add `draft: true` to the post's metadata. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
draft: true
---
```

When you are ready to publish the post, either remove the `draft` option or set it to `false`, then build the website.

Beyond support for drafts, Distill has a number of additional features to accommodate a variety of post authoring and contribution workflows, including importing posts published elsewhere on the web (e.g. on RPubs, in a Git repository, or on another blog). The article on [blog post workflow](blog_workflow.html) describes these options in more detail.

## Next steps

### Comments and sharing

Readers will likely want to comment on and share articles they read on your blog. You can enable support for [Disqus comments](https://disqus.com/) and sharing links for Twitter, LinkedIn, and other services by adding options to the `collection:posts` section of `_site.yml`.

For example, the following options provide the [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname) for a site and specify that we want sharing buttons for Twitter and LinkedIn.

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/
collections:
  posts:
    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r
    share: [twitter, linkedin]
```

The following footer is then automatically included at the end of each post:

![](images/social-footer.png){.screenshot width="80%"}

Note that the `base_url` field is required in order to use Disqus and sharing links.

Valid values for the `share` option are `twitter`, `linkedin`, `facebook`, `google-plus`, and `pinterest`.

By default, the full text of Disqus comments are not displayed (rather, a link is provided that will expand the comment section). This is done so that a long comment section doesn't obscure the bibliography and other appendices. If you'd rather show the comments by default you can use this alterante syntax for `disqus` configuration:

``` yaml
collections:
  posts:
    disqus: 
      shortname: reproducible-finance-with-r
      hidden: false
    share: [twitter, linkedin]
```

Specifying the `hidden: false` option for `disqus` will causes all comments to be displayed inline by default.

### Site search

Blog sites automatically include a search box within the navigation bar. You can disable the search box using the the `search` field of the `navbar` key within `_site.yml`. For example:

``` yaml
---
name: "distill"
title: "Distill for R Markdown"
navbar:
  logo:
    image: images/logo.png
    href: https://www.posit.co
  search: false
---
```

Note that top level articles within blog sites will also be included in search results so long as they have a `description` metadata field.

### Source code

If you want to display a link to the source code for your blog on the navigation bar, add a `source_url` field to the `navbar` definition. For example:

``` yaml
---
name: "distill"
title: "Distill for R Markdown"
navbar:
  logo:
    image: images/logo.png
    href: https://www.posit.co
  source_url: https://github.com/rstudio/distill
---
```

Note that if you've already defined a `repository_url` field in `_site.yml` you can just use `source_url: true` and your `repository_url` will be used for the link.

### Organizing posts

You can use whatever scheme you like to organize the `_posts` directory. You can have all posts at the top level or you can create subdirectories to create groupings of posts.

One popular scheme for organizing blog posts is to use a date prefix for the post directory names. For example:

``` markup
_posts/
  2017-11-09-visualizing-asset-returns/
  2017-09-13-asset-volatility/
  2017-03-07-quandl-and-forecasting/
  2016-11-08-sharpe-ratio/
```

The benefits of this scheme are that post names are given additional uniqueness (to guard against colliding names over the long term) and are also automatically listed in order when browsing the `_posts` directory.

Note that if you use a date-prefixed post directory you are not required to specify an explicit `date` field within your post's metadata.

### Preview images

Note that the listing for our example above includes a preview image for each post. Preview thumbnail images are generated automatically based on the first plot encountered within your post. You can specify that a specific plot should be used as the preview image using the `preview` chunk option. For example:

```` clike
```{r, layout="l-body-outset", preview=TRUE}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```
````

If you want to use another image entirely as a post preview you add a `preview` field to the post's metadata. For example, here we add a `preview` field to the example metadata from above (some fields excluded for brevity):

``` yaml
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
preview: images/sharpe-ratio.png
---
```

Preview images are also used for generating [Open Graph](metadata.html#open-graph) and [Twitter Card](metadata.html#twitter-card) metadata. However, since those systems require that preview images be specified as absolute URLs, you also need to add a `base_url` field to your `_site.yml` file as described above in [Getting Started].

### Citations

If your `_site.yml` file provides a `base_url` field, then an [article citation](citations.html) appendix and related metadata will be included automatically within all published posts. For example:

![](images/blog-citation.png){.screenshot width="95%"}

If you want to disable this behavior you can use the `collections:posts:citations` field within `_site.yml`. For example:

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/
collections:
  posts:
    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r
    share: [twitter, linkedin]
    citations: false
```

You can also disable citations for an individual post by adding `citation: false` to the post's YAML metadata.

### Subscriptions

You can add HTML that enables readers to subscribe to your blog by including the `collections:posts:subscribe` option within `_site.yml`. The `subscribe` option in turn points to an HTML file that provides the ability to subscribe to your blog. For example:

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/
collections:
  posts:
    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r
    share: [twitter, linkedin]
    subscribe: _subscribe.html
```

**\_subscribe.html**

``` html
<form method='post' action='https://blogtrottr.com'>
  <p>Enjoy this blog? Get notified of new posts via email:</p>
  <input type='text' name='btr_email' />
  <input type='hidden' name='btr_url'
         value='https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/index.xml'/>
  <input type='hidden' name='schedule_type' value='0' />
  <input type='submit' value='Subscribe' />
</form>
```

This example uses the [Blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/) service to provide an email subscription. You could also use another service or simply include a link to your RSS feed.

The contents of `_subscribe.html` will be included in both the sidebar of the main listing page as well as in the footer of articles. Note that relative URLs won't work in subscription HTML since the content appears at different levels of the site (thus we include the full URL to the RSS feed in the example above).

### Custom HTML

You can also add arbitrary HTML to the top of the sidebar by including the `collections:posts:custom` option within `_site.yml`. The `custom` option in turn points to an HTML file that will be displayed above the "Subscribe" and "Categories" sections. Unlike the Subscribe HTML, Cutstom HTML is not displayed in article footers. This custom feature can be used to display anything in the sidebar that Distill does not automatically generate. While only one custom file may be defined per collection, the HTML contained within is extremely adaptable to different use cases (even several simultaneously). For example, the below snippets will display an About section on top, and below that a search bar:

**\_site.yml**

``` yaml
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/
collections:
  posts:
    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r
    share: [twitter, linkedin]
    custom: _custom.html
```

**\_custom.html**

``` html
<div class="sidebar-section custom">
  <h3>About</h3>
  This blog explores reproducible finance with the 
  <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> 
  statistical computing environment.
</div>

<div class="sidebar-section custom">
  <h3>Search</h3>
  <form action="https://duckduckgo.com/">
    <input type="text" name="q" placeholder="Search...">
    <input type="hidden" name="sites" 
      value="https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/"> <!-- Replace with your blog URL -->
    <!--<button type="submit">Search</button>-->
  </form>
</div>
```

![](images/custom_html_example_about_search.png){.screenshot width="50%"}

While the custom HTML option inherits general CSS styling from the rest of the Distill blog, by default it does not inherit the sidebar-specific CSS. In order to fully match the rest of the sidebar sections, each section must be nested within a `<div class="sidebar-section custom">` tag, as seen in the above example. This configuration is intended to provide a good balance between flexibility and ease-of-use.

The example search bar functionality uses the popular [DuckDuckGo](duckduckgo.com) search engine. After entering search terms and hitting the enter key the user is taken to the search engine's website and shown relevant search results from the blog. Note that the blog will need to have been recently crawled by the search engine in order for search results to be thorough and up to date. Replacing the HTML snippet's hard-coded blog URL should be the only modification necessary to begin using this example. Other search engines may be used with further modification. The "Search" button has been left out in this example, but may be uncommented if desired.

### Supporting files

When a blog post is published, resource files located alongside the post in its directory are also published. The following files are *not* published by default:

1.  Files beginning with `"."` (hidden files).

2.  Files beginning with `"_"`

3.  Files known to contain R source code (e.g. `".R"`, `".s"`, `".Rmd"`), R data (e.g. `".RData"`, `".rds"`), or configuration data (e.g. `"rsconnect"` ,`"packrat"`, `"renv"`)).

You can override this behavior using a `resources` metadata entry for your post, which can specify explicit files to `include` or `exclude`. For example (some fields excluded for brevity):

``` yaml
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
resources:
  exclude:
    *.csv    
---
```

## Collections

As described above, adding a blog to a Distill website requires creating a "posts" collection (i.e. a `_posts` directory containing sub-directories, each of which includes an article) and adding a listing page for your posts (most often the site's home page).

In addition to "posts", you can add other collections of articles to your site with their own index pages. The main benefits of including articles within a collection are:

1.  The articles are never re-rendered unless you explicitly Knit them (which keeps your site building even if the R code within the article no longer runs due to e.g. changes in it's package dependencies).
2.  You can generate an index page and RSS feed for the collection.

### Creating a collection

To create a new article collection, do the following:

1.  Create a top level directory for the collection (e.g "\_analyses")

2.  Add an entry for it to your `_site.yml` file. For example:

    ``` yaml
    collections:
      posts: 
        categories: true
      analyses:
        categories: true
    ```

3.  Optionally, create an index page for your collection by adding the appropriate `listing` YAML front matter. For example, you could create a file named `analyses.Rmd` within the top-level directory of your website with the following YAML:

    ``` yaml
    ---
    title: "Analyses"
    listing: analyses
    ---
    ```

You may also want to add a link to your listing page in the [site navigation menu](website.html#site-navigation).

You can use the `create_post()` function to create articles within any collection. For example:

``` r
create_post("water-quality-trends", collection = "analyses")
```

## Theming

Distill blogs can use [themes](website.html#theming) and [CSS](website.html#custom-style) just like Distill sites. You can use the `create_theme()` function to add a theme CSS file in the current working directory.

For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
create_theme(name = "theme") 
```

Read more about customizing a Distill [theme](website.html#create-theme). To apply a custom theme site-wide, add a `theme` key to the top-level of your `_site.yml` configuration file:

``` yaml
name: "distill"
title: "Distill for R Markdown"
theme: theme.css 
navbar:
# (navbar definition here)
```

Blog posts (along with [listing](#listing-pages) and [custom listing pages](#custom-listings)) will follow the theme. Below are some examples of different themes applied to our demo blog.

```{r panelset, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::use_panelset()
```

## Publishing a blog

After you've authored one or more posts you will want to build the entire site before publishing it.

If your Distill website is contained within an RStudio project you can use the **Build Website** command available in the Build pane to generate the site:

![](images/build-website.png){.screenshot width="95%"}

To build a website from the command line, use the `rmarkdown::render_site()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
render_site()
```

There are a variety of options available for making your site available to others, see the article on [website publishing](publish_website.html) for details.

## Examples

-   The [distill reference site](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/distill) includes several [example sites and blogs](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/distill/articles/examples.html).

-   An example which reproduces several posts from the Reproducible Finance with R series on the R Views blog can be found here: <https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/11424/>
